1.  Introduction

   The purpose of this document is to define a base network inventory
   YANG data model that is application- and technology-agnostic.  The
   base data model can be augmented to describe application-specific or
   technology-specific information.

   Network Inventory management is a key component in operators' OSS
   architectures.

   Network Inventory is a fundamental functionality in network
   management and was specified many years ago.  Given the emergence of
   data models and their deployment in operator's management and control
   systems, the traditional function of inventory management is also
   requested to be defined as a data model.

   Network Inventory management and monitoring is a critical part for
   ensuring the network stays healthy, well-planned, and functioning in
   the operator's network.  Network Inventory management allows the
   operator to keep track of which physical devices are deployed in the
   network including relevant software and hardware versions.

   The Network Inventory management also helps the operator to know when
   to acquire new assets and what is needed, or to decommission old or
   faulty ones, which can help to improve network performance and
   capacity planning.

   In [I-D.ietf-teas-actn-poi-applicability] a gap was identified
   regarding the lack of a YANG data model that could be used at ACTN
   MPI interface level to report whole/partial network hardware
   inventory information available at domain controller level towards
   north-bound systems (e.g., MDSC or OSS layer).

   [RFC8345] initial goal was to make possible the augmentation of the
   YANG data model with Network Inventory data model but this was never
   developed and the scope was kept limited to network topology data
   only.

   It is key for operators to drive the industry towards the use of a
   standard YANG data model for Network Inventory data instead of using
   vendors proprietary APIs (e.g., REST API).

   In the ACTN architecture, this would bring also clear benefits at
   MDSC level for packet over optical integration scenarios since this
   would enable the correlation of the HW network inventory information
   with the links information reported in the network topology model.
   This represent a priority for operators to implement this with a
   standard YANG data model that could be used as soon as possible in
   multi-vendor integrations of PNCs with MDSCs.

   The intention is to define a generic YANG base data model that would
   be as much as possible technology agnostic (valid for IP, optical and
   microwave networks) and that could be augmented, when required, to
   include some technology-specific inventory details together with
   specific HW or SW component’s attributes.

   [RFC8348] defines a YANG data model for the management of the
   hardware on a single server and therefore it is more applicable to
   the domain controller South Bound Interface (SBI) towards the network
   elements rather than at the domain controller's northbound.  However,
   the YANG data model defined in [RFC8348] has been used as a reference
   for defining the YANG network inventory data model presented in this
   draft.

   The proposed YANG data model has been analyzed at the present stage
   to cover the common requirements for both HW and SW use cases for
   Network Inventory.

   Network Inventory is a collection of data for network devices and
   their components managed by a specific management system.  Per the
   definition of [RFC8969],the network inventory model is a network
   model.

   This document defines one YANG module "ietf-network-inventory" in
   Section 5.

   Section 3 provides a set of augmentation considerations for
   extensions of hardware, software, entitlement, and inventory topology
   mapping.

   The YANG data model defined in this document conforms to the Network
   Management Datastore Architecture [RFC8342].

      a collection of data for network devices and their components
      managed by a specific management system.

   Network Element:

      a manageable network entity that contains hardware and software
      units, e.g. a network device installed on one or several chassis

   Chassis:

      bios, and boot-loader

   Board/Card:

      a pluggable equipment can be inserted into one or several slots/
      sub-slots and can afford a specific transmission function
      independently.

2.  YANG Data Model for Network Inventory Overview

   The network element definition is generalized to support physical
   devices and other types of inventory objects (e.g., virtual network
   elements) that can be managed as physical network elements from an
   inventory perspective.  The data model for Network Element presented
   in this document uses a flat list of network element.

   The "ne-type" is defined as a YANG identity to describe the type of
   the network element.  This document defines only the "physical-
   network-element" identity.

   The component definition is also generalized to support any type of
   component, such as hardware, software, or firmware.

   The component "class" is defined as a union between the hardware
   class identity, defined in "iana-hardware", and the "non-hardware"
   identity, defined in this document.

   The identity definition of additional types of "ne-type" and "non-
   hardware" identity of component are outside the scope of this
   document and could be defined in application-specific or technology-
   specific companion augmentation data models, such as
   [I-D.wzwb-ivy-network-inventory-software].

   In [RFC8348], rack, chassis, slot, sub-slot, board and port are
   defined as components of network elements with generic attributes.

   While [RFC8348] is used to manage the hardware of a single server
   (e.g., a network element), the Network Inventory YANG data model is
   used to retrieve the base network inventory information that a
   controller discovers from all the network elements under its control.

   However, the YANG data model defined in [RFC8348] has been used as a
   reference for defining the YANG network inventory data model.  This
   approach can simplify the implementation of this network inventory
   model when the controller uses the YANG data model defined in
   [RFC8348] to retrieve the hardware from the network elements under
   its control.

     +--rw network-elements
        +--rw network-element* [ne-id]
           +--rw ne-id            string
           ............................................
           +--rw components
              +--rw component* [component-id]
                 +--rw component-id            string
                 ......................................

2.1.  Common Design for All Inventory Objects

   For all the inventory objects, there are some common attributes
   existing.  Such as:

   Identifier: here we suggest to use uuid format which is widely
   implemented with systems.  It is guaranteed to be globally unique.

   Name: name is a human-readable label information which could be used
   to present on GUI.  This name is suggested to be provided by server.

   Alias: alias is also a human-readable label information which could
   be modified by user.  It could also be present on GUI instead of
   name.

   Description: description is a human-readable information which could
   be also input by user.  Description provides more detailed
   information to prompt users when performing maintenance operations.

     +--rw network-elements
        +--rw network-element* [ne-id]
           +--rw ne-id            string
           +--rw ne-type?         identityref
           +--rw uuid?            yang:uuid
           +--rw name?            string
           +--rw description?     string
           +--rw alias?           string
           ...................................
           +--rw components
              +--rw component* [component-id]
                 +--rw component-id            string
                 +--rw uuid?                   yang:uuid
                 +--rw name?                   string
                 +--rw description?            string
                 +--rw alias?                  string
                 +--rw class                   union
                 ...................................

2.2.  Network Element

   To be consistent with the component definition, some of the
   attributes defined in [RFC8348] for components are reused for network
   elements.  These attributes include:

     +--rw network-elements
        +--rw network-element* [ne-id]
           ...................................
           +--rw hardware-rev?    string
           +--rw software-rev?    string
           +--rw mfg-name?        string
           +--rw mfg-date?        yang:date-and-time
           +--rw part-number?     string
           +--rw serial-number?   string
           +--rw product-name?    string
           ...................................

   Note: Not all the attributes defined in [RFC8348] are applicable for
   network element.  And there could also be some missing attributes
   which are not recognized by [RFC8348].  More extensions could be
   introduced in later revisions after the missing attributes are fully
   discussed.

2.3.  Components

   The YANG data model for network inventory mainly follows the same
   approach of [RFC8348] and reports the network hardware inventory as a
   list of components with different types (e.g., chassis, module,
   port).

   The component definition is generalized to both hardware components
   and non-hardware components (e.g., software components).

     +--rw components
         +--rw component* [component-id]
           +--rw component-id            string
           +--rw uuid?                   yang:uuid
           +--rw name?                   string
           +--rw description?            string
           +--rw alias?                  string
           +--rw class                   union
           +--rw child-component-ref
           +--rw parent-rel-pos?         int32
           +--rw parent-component-ref
           +--rw hardware-rev?           string
           +--rw firmware-rev?           string
           +--rw software-rev?           string
           +--rw serial-num?             string
           +--rw mfg-name?               string
           +--rw part-number?            string
           +--rw asset-id?               string
           +--rw is-fru?                 boolean
           +--rw mfg-date?               yang:date-and-time
           +--rw uri*                    inet:uri

   For state data like admin-state, oper-state and so on, we consider
   they are related to device hardware management and not network
   inventory.  Therefore, they are outside of scope of this document.
   Same for the sensor-data, they should be defined in some other
   performance monitoring data models instead of inventory data model.

2.3.1.  Hardware Components

   Based on TMF classification in [TMF_SD2-20], hardware components can
   be divided into two groups, holder group and equipment group.  The
   holder group contains rack, chassis, slot, sub-slot while the
   equipment group contains network-element, board and port.

   The relationship between typical inventory objects in a physical
   network element can be described by Figure 1 below:

        Figure 1: Relationship between typical inventory objects in
                         physical network elements

   The "iana-hardware" module [IANA_YANG] defines YANG identities for
   the hardware component types in the IANA-maintained "IANA-ENTITY-MIB"
   registry.

   Some of the definitions taken from [RFC8348] are actually based on
   the ENTITY-MIB [RFC6933].

   For the additional attributes of specific hardware, such as CPU,
   storage, port, power supply is defined in the hardware extension.

2.3.2.  Software Components

   This document defines "software-rev" of NEs and components, which are
   basic software attributes of a Network Element.

   The software and hardware components share the same attributes of the
   component and have similar replaceable requirements.  Generally, the
   device also has other software data, for example, one or more
   software patch information.

   The software components of other classes, such as platform software,
   BIOS, bootloader, and software patch information, are outside the
   scope of this document and defined other documents such as
   [I-D.wzwb-ivy-network-inventory-software].

2.4.  Changes with respect to RFC8348

   We re-defined some attributes listed in [RFC8348], based on some
   integration experience for network wide inventory data.

2.4.1.  New Parent Identifiers' Reference

   [RFC8348] provided a "parent-ref" attribute, which was an identifier
   reference to its parent component.  When the MDSC or OSS systems want
   to find this component's grandparent or higher level component in the
   hierarchy, they need to retrieve this parent-ref step by step.  To
   reduce this iterative work, we decided to provide a list of
   hierarchical parent components' identifier references.

     +--ro components
        +--ro component* [uuid]
           ...................................
           +--ro parent-component-references
           |   +--ro component-reference* [index]
           |      +--ro index    uint8
           |      +--ro class?   -> ../../../class
           |      +--ro uuid?    -> ../../../uuid
           ...................................

   The hierarchical components' identifier could be found by the
   "component-reference" list.  The "index" attribute is used to order
   the list by the hierarchical relationship from topmost component
   (with the "index" set to 0) to bottom component.

2.4.2.  Component-Specific Info Design

   According to the management requirements from operators, some
   important attributes are not defined in [RFC8348].  These attributes
   could be component-specific and are not suitable to define under the
   component list node.  So, the model can be augmented with HW/SW
   specific-info-grouping containing attributes applicable to HW e.g.
   boards/slot or SW e.g. software-module/boot-loader component only.

     augment /ni:network-elements/ni:network-element:
       +--rw virtual-ne-attributes
     augment /ni:network-elements/ni:network-element/ni:components
               /ni:component:
       +--rw software-module-specific-info

2.4.3.  Part Number

   According to the description in [RFC8348], the attribute named
   "model-name" under the component, is preferred to have a customer-
   visible part number value.  "Model-name" is not straightforward to
   understand and we suggest to rename it as "part-number" directly.

     +--ro components
        +--ro component* [uuid]
           ...................................
           +--ro part-number?           string
           ...................................

2.5.  Efficiency Issue

   During the integration with OSS in some operators, some efficiency/
   scalability concerns have been discovered when synchronizing network
   inventory data for big networks.  More discussions are needed to
   address these concerns.

   Considering that relational databases are widely used by traditional
   OSS systems and also by some network controllers, the inventory
   objects are most likely to be saved in different tables.  With the
   model defined in current draft, when doing a full synchronization,
   network controller needs to convert all inventory objects of each NE
   into component objects and combine them together into a single list,
   and then construct a response and send to OSS or MDSC.  The OSS or
   MDSC needs to classify the component list and divide them into
   different groups, in order to save them in different tables.  The
   combining-regrouping steps are impacting the network controller &
   OSS/MDSC processing, which may result in efficiency/scalability
   limitations in large scale networks.

   An alternative YANG model structure, which defines the inventory
   objects directly, instead of defining generic components, has also
   been analyzed.  However, also with this model, there still could be
   some scalability limitations when synchronizing full inventory
   resources in large scale of networks.  This scalability limitation is
   caused by the limited transmission capabilities of HTTP protocol.  We
   think that this scalability limitation should be solved at protocol
   level rather than data model level.

   The model proposed by this draft is designed to be as generic as
   possible so to cover future special types of inventory objects that
   could be used in other technologies, that have not been identified
   yet.  If the inventory objects were to be defined directly with fixed
   hierarchical relationships in YANG model, this new type of inventory
   objects needs to be manually defined, which is not a backward
   compatible change and therefore is not an acceptable approach for
   implementation.  With a generic model, it is only needed to augment a
   new component class and extend some specific attributes for this new
   inventory component class, which is more flexible.  We consider that
   this generic data model, enabling a flexible and backward compatible
   approach for other technologies, represents the main scope of this
   draft.  Solution description to efficiency/scalability limitations
   mentioned above is considered as out-of-scope.

3.  Extending Network Inventory

   This document defines the basic network inventory attributes
   applicable to typical network scenarios.  For finer-grained and
   specific management scenarios, the relationship between this model
   and other models is illustrated in Figure 4.

A.1.  Comparison With Openconfig-platform Data Model

   Since more and more devices can be managed by domain controller
   through OpenConfig, to ensure that our inventory data model can cover
   these devices' inventory data, we have compared our inventory data
   model with the "openconfig-platform" model which is the data model
   used to manage inventory information in OpenConfig.

   Openconfig-platform data model is NE-level and uses a generic
   component concept to describe its inner devices and containers, which
   is similar to "ietf-hardware" model in [RFC8348].  Since we have also
   reused the component concept of [RFC8348] in our inventory data
   model, we can compare the component's attributes between "openconfig-
   platform" and our model directly , which is stated below:

      Table 2: Comparison between openconfig platform and inventory
                               data models

   As it mentioned in Section 2.3 that state data and performance data
   are out of scope of our data model, it is same for alarm data and it
   should be defined in some other alarm data models separately.  And
   for some component specific structures in "openconfig-platform", we
   consider some of them can be contained by our existing structure,
   such as fan, backplane, and controller-card, while some others do not
   need to be included in this network inventory model like storage and
   cpu.

   Mostly, our inventory data model can cover the attributes from
   OpenConfig.
