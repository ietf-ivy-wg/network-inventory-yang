1.  Introduction

   This document defines a base YANG data model for reporting network
   inventory that is application- and technology-agnostic.  The base
   data model can be augmented to describe application- and technology-
   specific information.  Please note that the usage of term "network
   inventory", in the context of this I-D, is to indicate that it is
   describing "network-wide" scope inventory information.

   Network Inventory is a collection of data for network devices and
   their components managed by a specific management system.

   Network inventory is a fundamental functional block in the overall
   network management which was specified many years ago.  Network
   inventory management is a critical part for ensuring that the network
   remains healthy (e.g., auditing to identify faulty elements), well-
   planned (e.g., identify assets to upgrade or to decommission), and
   maintained appropriately to meet the performance objectives.  Also,
   network inventory management allows operators to keep track of which
   devices are deployed in their networks, including relevant embedded
   software and hardware versions.

   Exposing standard interfaces to retrieve network elements
   capabilities as maintained in an inventory are key enablers for many
   applications.  For example, [I-D.ietf-teas-actn-poi-applicability]
   identifies a gap about the lack of YANG data models that could be
   used at Abstraction and Control of TE Networks (ACTN) Multi-Domain
   Service Coordinator-Provisioning Network Controller Interface (MPI)
   level to report whole or partial network hardware inventory
   information available at domain controller level towards upper layer
   systems (e.g., Multi-Domain Service Coordinator (MDSC) or Operations
   Support Systems (OSS) layers).

   It is key for operators to coordinate with the industry towards the
   use of a standard YANG data model for Network Inventory data instead
   of using vendors proprietary APIs.

   [RFC8348] defines a YANG data model for the management of the
   hardware on a single server and therefore it is more applicable to
   the domain controller towards the network elements rather than at the
   northbound interface of a network controller (e.g., toward an
   application or another hierarchical network controller).  However,
   the YANG data model defined in [RFC8348] has been used as a reference
   for defining the YANG network inventory data model presented in this
   document.

   Per the definition of [RFC8969], the YANG data model defined in
   [RFC8348] is a device model while the YANG data model defined in this
   document is a network model.

   This document defines one YANG module "ietf-network-inventory" in
   Section 5.

   This base data model is application- and technology-agnostic (that
   is, valid for IP/MPLS, optical, and microwave networks as well as
   optical local loops, access networks, core networks, data centers,
   etc.) and can be augmented to include required application- and
   technology-specific inventory details together with specific hardware
   or software component's attributes.

   The YANG data model defined in the document is scoped to cover the
   common use cases for Inventory but at network-wide level, covering
   both hardware and base software information.

   The YANG data model defined in this document conforms to the Network
   Management Datastore Architecture [RFC8342].

   The following terms are defined in [RFC7950] and are not redefined
   here:

   *  server

   *  augment

   *  data model

   *  data node

   The following terms are defined in [RFC6241] and are not redefined
   here:

   *  configuration data

   *  state data

   The following terms are defined in [RFC8342] and are not redefined

      Elsewhere, a chassis can be called shelf, sub-rack, stand-alone
      unit, etc.

   Port:  A component where networking traffic can be received and/or
      transmitted, e.g., by attaching networking cables.

      In case of pluggable ports, the port may be empty when no
      pluggable module is plugged in.

   Also, the document makes use of the following terms:

   Network Inventory:  A collection of data for network elements and
      their components with network-wide scope, managed by a specific
      management system.

   Physical Network Element:  An implementation or application specific
      group of components (e.g., hardware components).

   Network Element:  The generalization of the physical network element
      definition.

   Hardware Component:  The generalization of the hardware components
      defined in [IANA_HW_YANG] (e.g., backplane, battery, container,
      cpu, chassis, fan, module, port, power supply, sensor, stack, and
      storage device components).

      The list of hardware components can be extended in future versions
      of [IANA_ENTITY_MIB] (and, consequently, of ([IANA_HW_YANG]).

   Component:  The generalization of the hardware component definition
      to include other inventory objects which can be managed, from an
      inventory perspective, like hardware components.

   Card:  A pluggable equipment with a particular structural format and
      dimensions which can be inserted into one or more slots (or sub-
      slots).  A card can have spaces (called sub-slots) to take other
      cards.

      Elsewhere, a card can be called board, module, circuit pack, etc..

   Slot:  A space in a chassis that can be equipped with one card, which
      may be chosen from a limited range of types of cards.  A slot can
      be subdivided into smaller spaces (called sub-slots).

   Container:  A hardware component class that is capable of containing
      one or more removable physical entities (e.g., a slot in a chassis
      is containing a board).

3.  YANG Data Model for Network Inventory Overview

   The base network inventory model, defined in this document, provides
   a list of network elements and of network element components:

   The network-inventory top level container has been defined to support
   reporting other types of network inventory objects, besides the
   network elements and network element components.

   These additional types of network inventory objects can be defined,
   together with the associated YANG data model and the rationale for
   managing them as part of the network inventory, in other documents
   providing application- and technology-specific companion augmentation
   data models, such as [I-D.ietf-ivy-network-inventory-location].

   The network element definition is generalized to support physical
   network elements and other types of components' groups that can be
   managed as physical network elements from an inventory perspective.

   Physical network elements are usually devices such as hosts,
   gateways, terminal servers, and the like, which have management
   agents responsible for performing the network management functions
   requested by the network management stations ([RFC1157]).

   The "ne-type" is defined as a YANG identity to describe the type of
   the network element.  This document defines only the "physical-
   network-element" identity.

   Other types of network elements can be defined in other documents,
   together with the associated YANG identity and the rationale for
   managing them as network elements from an inventory perspective.

   The component definition is also generalized to support any types of
   component inventory objects that can be managed as hardware
   components from an inventory perspective.

   The data model for components defined in this document uses a list of
   components within each network element.

   Different types of components can be distinguished by the class of
   component.  The component "class" is defined as a union between the
   hardware class identity, defined in "iana-hardware", and the "non-
   hardware" identity, defined in this document.

   Other types of components can be defined in other documents, together
   with the associated YANG identity and the rationale for managing them
   as components from an inventory perspective.

   The identity definition of additional types of "ne-type" and "non-
   hardware" identity of component are outside the scope of this
   document and could be defined in application- and technology-specific
   companion augmentation data models, such as
   [I-D.ietf-ivy-network-inventory-software].

   In [RFC8348], rack, chassis, slot, sub-slot, board and port are
   defined as components of network elements with generic attributes.

   While [RFC8348] is used to manage the hardware of a single server
   (e.g., a network element), the Network Inventory YANG data model is
   used to retrieve the base inventory information that a controller
   discovers from all the network elements with network-wide scope under
   its control.

   However, the YANG data model defined in [RFC8348] has been used as a
   reference for defining the YANG network inventory data model.  This
   approach can simplify the implementation of this inventory model when
   the controller uses the YANG data model defined in [RFC8348] to
   retrieve the hardware from the network elements under its control.

3.1.  Common attributes for inventory object

   For all the inventory objects, there are some common attributes, such
   as:

   uuid:  The Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) of the inventory
      object, assigned by the server.  Such identifiers are widely
      implemented with systems and guaranteed to be globally unique.

   name:  A human-readable label information of the inventory object,
      which could be assigned by the server.  It could also be present
      on a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

   alias:  A human-readable label information of the inventory object,
      provided by a network operator.  It could also be present on a GUI
      instead as well as the name.

   description:  A human-readable description of the inventory object,
      provided by a network operator or by the server.  The description
      provides more detailed information to prompt users when performing
      maintenance operations etc.

3.1.1.  Common attributes for network elements and components

   To be consistent with the component definition, some of the
   attributes defined in [RFC8348] for components are reused for network
   elements, such as:

   mfg-name:  The name of the manufacturer of the entity (component or
      network element).

   product-name:  The vendor-specific and human-interpretable string
      describing the entity (component or network element) type.

      It is expected that vendors assign unique product names to
      different entities within the scope of the vendor.

   Other software-related attributes are defined in Section 3.3.2 and
   applicable to network elements and components.

3.2.  Network Element

   In addition to the common attributes defined for network elements and
   components in Section 3.1, the following attributes are defined for
   the network elements:

   ne-id:  The identifier that uniquely identifies the NE within the
      network, assigned by the server since the network elements cannot
      guaranteed that their local identifier is unique within the
      network.

      The ne-id should be assigned such that the same network element
      will always be identified through the same identifier, even if the
      network elements get disconnected from the network controller.
      Mechanisms to ensure this (e.g., checking the mfg-name, product-
      name, management IP address, physical location) are implementation
      specific and outside the scope of standardization.

   ne-type:  The type of network element (e.g., physical network
      element).  See Section 3 for the definition of NE types.

   product-rev:  A vendor-specific product revision string for the
      network-element.

3.3.  Components

   The YANG data model for network inventory mainly follows the same
   approach of [RFC8348] and reports the network hardware inventory as a
   list of components with different types (e.g., chassis, module, and
   port).

   In addition to the common attributes defined for network elements and
   components in Section 3.1, the following attributes are defined for
   the network elements:

   component-id:  The identifier that uniquely identifies the component
      within the NE.  It can be assigned by the NE or by the server.

   class:  The type of component (e.g., chassis, module, port).  See
      Section 3 for the definition of component types.

   hardware-rev:  The vendor-specific hardware revision string for the
      component.

      The preferred value is the hardware revision identifier actually
      printed on the component itself (if present).

   mfg-date:  The date of manufacturing of the component.

   part-number:  The vendor-specific part number of the component type.

      It is expected that vendors assign unique part numbers to
      different component types within the scope of the vendor.

   serial-number:  The vendor-specific serial number of the the
      component instance.

      It is expected that vendors assign unique serial numbers to
      different component instances at least within the scope of the
      part-number.

   asset-id:  An asset tracking identifier for the component, provided
      by a network operator.

   is-fru:  Indicates whether or not a component is considered a 'field-
      replaceable unit' by the vendor.

   For state data like "admin-state", "oper-state", and so on, this
   document considers that they are related to device hardware
   management, not network inventory.  Therefore, they are outside of
   the scope of this document.  Same for the sensor-data, they should be
   defined in some other performance monitoring data models instead of
   the inventory data model.

3.3.1.  Hardware Components

   Based on TMF classification in [TMF_SD2-20], hardware components can
   be divided into two groups, holder group and equipment group.  The
   holder group contains rack, chassis, slot, sub-slot while the
   equipment group contains network-element, board and port.

   Figure 1 describes the relationship between typical inventory objects
   in a physical network element.

        Figure 1: Relationship between typical inventory objects in
                         physical network elements

   The "iana-hardware" module [IANA_HW_YANG] defines YANG identities for
   the hardware component types in the IANA-maintained "IANA-ENTITY-MIB"
   registry.

   Some of the definitions taken from [RFC8348] are based on the ENTITY-
   MIB [RFC6933].

   Additional attributes of specific hardware, such as CPU, storage,
   port, or power supply are defined in the hardware extension.

3.3.2.  Software Components

   This document defines a "software-rev" list for NEs and components,
   which provide basic software attributes for network elements and
   components.

   The scope of the list is to provide information about the software
   modules configured to be active on the related entity (network
   element or component).

   The model supports scenarios where multiple software modules can be
   configured to be active on the entity.  For example, on a network
   element an Operating System and an Application software modules can
   be configured to be active; in the same way, on a component like a
   circuit pack a boot-loader, a firmware and one or more FPGA software
   modules can be configured to be active.

   For each software module, configured to be active, the name and
   version information is provided.

   The management of inactive/standby software modules and of the
   software upgrade or downgrade life-cycle are outside the scope of the
   base inventory model and can be addressed in other models which
   augment the base inventory model such as the model under definition
   in [I-D.ietf-ivy-network-inventory-software].

   The software and hardware components share the same attributes of the
   component and have similar replaceable requirements.  Generally, the
   device also has other software data, for example, one or more
   software patch information.

   The software components of other classes, such as platform software,
   BIOS, bootloader, and software patch information, are outside the
   scope of this document and defined other documents such as
   [I-D.ietf-ivy-network-inventory-software].

3.4.  Changes Since RFC 8348

   This document re-defines some attributes listed in [RFC8348], based
   on some integration experience for network inventory data.

3.4.1.  Part Number

   According to the description in [RFC8348], the attribute named
   "model-name" under the component, is preferred to have a customer-
   visible part number value.  "Model-name" is not straightforward to
   understand and we suggest to rename it as "part-number" directly.

3.4.2.  Component identifiers

   There are some use cases where the name of the components are
   assigned and changed by the operator.  In these cases, the assigned
   names are also not guaranteed to be always unique.

   In order to support these use cases, this model is not aligned with
   [RFC8348] in defining the component name as the key for the component
   list.

   Instead the name is defined as an optional attribute and the
   component-id is defined as the key for the component list (in
   alignment with the approach followed for the network-element list).

                  Figure 3: Network inventory YANG module

6.  Operational Considerations

   The network inventory YANG data model defined in the document is
   intended to report the actual inventory data that a network
   controller knows of the network elements and components actually
   installed within the network.  Therefore, this data model provides a
   read-only perspective of the network inventory information.

   As outlined in Section 1, per the definition of [RFC8969], the
   network inventory model is a network model.

   This information can be provided by a network controller to an higher
   level hierarchical network controller, to an Inventory OSS or to any
   other type of application which needs to discover the network
   inventory information.

   For example, in the context of ACTN, the network inventory YANG data
   model can be used at the MPI interfaces, as defined in [RFC8453], or
   on an interface, not defined in [RFC8453] between the MDSC and the
   Inventory OSS.

   The information in the model is populated by controller by reading it
   from the devices using the device model supported by the devices.
   This model does not constraint the device models used on the device:
   the YANG data model defined in [RFC8348] is an option but other
   options (e.g., vendor specific interfaces or YANG data models) are
   also allowed.  In case some information is not provided by the
   device, the network controller SHALL omit this information unless
   this information is known by other sources of information (e.g.,
   through local configuration within the network controller).

   In case of hierarchical controllers, a hierarchical network
   controller can also collect the network inventory information from
   its lower level network controllers using this YANG data model (or
   other mechanisms which are outside the scope of this document) and
   report the combined network inventory information to an an higher
   level network controller, to an Inventory OSS or to any other type of
   application which needs to discover the network inventory
   information.

7.  Security Considerations

   This section is modeled after the template described in Section 3.7
   of [I-D.ietf-netmod-rfc8407bis].

   The "ietf-network-inventory" YANG module defines a data model that is
   designed to be accessed via YANG-based management protocols, such as
   NETCONF [RFC6241] and RESTCONF [RFC8040].  These YANG-based
   management protocols (1) have to use a secure transport layer (e.g.,
   SSH [RFC4252], TLS [RFC8446], and QUIC [RFC9000]) and (2) have to use
   mutual authentication.

   The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) [RFC8341]
   provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or
   RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or
   RESTCONF protocol operations and content.

   Some of the readable data nodes in this YANG module may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
   important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config, or
   notification) to these data nodes.  Specifically, the following
   subtrees and data nodes have particular sensitivities/
   vulnerabilities:

   Specifically, the following subtrees and data nodes have particular
   sensitivities/vulnerabilities:

   *  "/nwi:network-elements"

      This subtree reports the inventory information for all the network
      elements and their hardware components deployed within the network
      as well as of the software modules being active on these network
      elements and components.  Unauthorized access to this subtree can
      disclose this information.  A malicious attacker can use this
      information to perform targeted attacks to network elements,
      hardware components or software modules with known
      vulnerabilities.

   Modules that use the groupings that are defined in this document
   should identify the corresponding security considerations.  For
   example, reusing the 'component-attributes' grouping may expose
   sensitive information.

8.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to register the following URI in the "ns" registry
   within the "IETF XML Registry" group [RFC3688]:

         URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:ietf-network-inventory
         Registrant Contact: The IESG
         XML: N/A; the requested URI is an XML namespace.

   IANA is requested to register the following YANG module in the "YANG
   Module Names" registry [RFC6020] within the "YANG Parameters"
   registry group.

        name:         ietf-network-inventory
        namespace:    urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-network-inventory
        prefix:       nwi
        reference:    RFC XXXX

Appendix A.  Comparison With Openconfig-platform Data Model

   Since more and more devices can be managed by domain controller
   through OpenConfig, to ensure that our inventory data model can cover
   these devices' inventory data, we have compared our inventory data
   model with the "openconfig-platform" model which is the data model
   used to manage inventory information in OpenConfig.

   Openconfig-platform data model is NE-level and uses a generic
   component concept to describe its inner devices and containers, which
   is similar to "ietf-hardware" model in [RFC8348].  Since we have also
   reused the component concept of [RFC8348] in our inventory data
   model, we can compare the component's attributes between "openconfig-
   platform" and our model directly , which is stated below:

       Table 2: Comparison between openconfig platform and inventory
                                data models

   As it mentioned in Section 3.3 that state data and performance data
   are out of scope of our data model, it is same for alarm data and it
   should be defined in some other alarm data models separately.  And
   for some component specific structures in "openconfig-platform", we
   consider some of them can be contained by our existing structure,
   such as fan, backplane, and controller-card, while some others do not
   need to be included in this network inventory model like storage and
   cpu.

   Mostly, our inventory data model can cover the attributes from
   OpenConfig.

Appendix B.  Terminology of Container

   Within this document , with the term "container" we consider an
   hardware component class capable of containing one or more removable
   physical entities, e.g. a slot in a chassis is containing a board.

Appendix C.  Efficiency Issue

   During the integration with OSS in some operators, some efficiency/
   scalability concerns have been discovered when synchronizing network
   inventory data for big networks.  More discussions are needed to
   address these concerns.

   Considering that relational databases are widely used by traditional
   OSS systems and also by some network controllers, the inventory
   objects are most likely to be saved in different tables.  With the
   model defined in current draft, when doing a full synchronization,
   network controller needs to convert all inventory objects of each NE
   into component objects and combine them together into a single list,
   and then construct a response and send to OSS or MDSC.  The OSS or
   MDSC needs to classify the component list and divide them into
   different groups, in order to save them in different tables.  The
   combining-regrouping steps are impacting the network controller &
   OSS/MDSC processing, which may result in efficiency/scalability
   limitations in large scale networks.

   An alternative YANG model structure, which defines the inventory
   objects directly, instead of defining generic components, has also
   been analyzed.  However, also with this model, there still could be
   some scalability limitations when synchronizing full inventory
   resources in large scale of networks.  This scalability limitation is
   caused by the limited transmission capabilities of HTTP protocol.  We
   think that this scalability limitation should be solved at protocol
   level rather than data model level.

   The model proposed by this draft is designed to be as generic as
   possible so to cover future special types of inventory objects that
   could be used in other technologies, that have not been identified
   yet.  If the inventory objects were to be defined directly with fixed
   hierarchical relationships in YANG model, this new type of inventory
   objects needs to be manually defined, which is not a backward
   compatible change and therefore is not an acceptable approach for
   implementation.  With a generic model, it is only needed to augment a
   new component class and extend some specific attributes for this new
   inventory component class, which is more flexible.  We consider that
   this generic data model, enabling a flexible and backward compatible
   approach for other technologies, represents the main scope of this
   draft.  Solution description to efficiency/scalability limitations
   mentioned above is considered as out-of-scope.

Appendix D.  Examples of ports

   This appendix provides some examples of port implementations and how
   they can be modelled using the "ietf-network-inventory" module
   defined in Section 5.

   Figure 4 shows an example of a single board which contains three type
   of ports:

   1.  An integrated port (non pluggable);

   2.  An empty port;

   3.  A pluggable port

Appendix E.  Example of multi-chassis network elements

   This appendix provides some examples of multi-chassis network
   elements and how they can be modelled using the "ietf-network-
   inventory" module defined in Section 5.

   Multi-chassis network elements are network elements composed by two
   or more chassis interconnected, in principle, with any topology.

   Stacked switches are an example of multi-chassis which consist of
   multiple standalone switches that are interconnected through
   dedicated stack ports and cables and managed as a single logical
   unit.  Stacked switch: - are connected using a daisy-chain or a ring
   topology - are managed using a single IP Address - synchronized
   software-upgrade - use Priority/MAC-Addr(s) decide Master/Members
   selection and communication.

   Figure 5 and Figure 6 describe two examples of stacked switch with
   three stacked switches (pizza boxes) connected in a daisy-chain or
   ring topology.

          Figure 6: Example of a stacked switch in a ring topology

   Using the base network inventory YANG data model, each stackable
   switch can be modelled as a chassis within the same network element,
   which models the stacked switch.  The stack ports are modelled like
   other ports.  The stack cables are not reported using the base
   network inventory YANG data model but can be reported using the
   passive network inventory YANG data model under definition in
   [I-D.ygb-ivy-passive-network-inventory].

   Cascaded switches are another example of multi-chassis which consist
   of multiple standalone switches that are interconnected and managed
   as a single logical unit.  Cascaded switch: - are usually connected
   in a tree topology - are managed using a single IP Address - the root
   of the tree is configured as Master.

   Figure 7 describe an example of cascaded switch with three chassis
   connected in a tree topology.

         Figure 7: Example of a cascaded switch in a tree topology

   Using the base network inventory YANG data model each interconnected
   switch can be modelled as a chassis within the same network element,
   which models the cascaded switch.  The ports used to interconnect the
   different chassis are normal (traffic) ports and modelled like other
   ports.  The interconnecting cables are not reported using the base
   network inventory YANG data model but can be reported using the
   passive network inventory model under definition in
   [I-D.ygb-ivy-passive-network-inventory].

E.1.  JSON Examples

   This appendix contains an example of an instance data tree in JSON
   encoding [RFC7951], instantiating the "ietf-network-inventory" model
   to describe the three examples of multi-chassis NEs, as shown in
   Figure 5, Figure 6 and Figure 7.

      Note: the base inventory model allows reporting only the chassis
      and ports configuration.  Reporting the link between the chassis
      of the same NE is outside the scope of the base inventory model.
      The YANG data model under definition in
      [I-D.ygb-ivy-passive-network-inventory] as an augmentation of the
      base inventory YANG data model can be used to provide this
      additional information.

Appendix F.  Example of non-modular network elements

   This appendix provides some examples of non-modular network elements
   and how they can be modelled using the "ietf-network-inventory"
   module defined in Section 5.

   Non-modular network elements (also known as "pizza boxes") are
   network elements composed by a single chassis (with a 1U horizontal
   oriented rectangular shape) as a self-contained system.  A non-
   modular network element does not have any slots to take cards so it
   cannot take any non-field replaceable modules other than pluggable
   ports.

   Using the base network inventory YANG data model a non-modular
   network element can be modelled as a network element containing only
   one chassis and ports (as child components of the chassis).

   Reporting the single chassis component within a non-modular network
   element is required because the chassis component is the type of
   component which provides the physical characteristics of the network
   element chassis (the network element is defined just as an assembly
   of components) and its location, using the network inventory YANG
   data model under definition in
   [I-D.ietf-ivy-network-inventory-location].

F.1.  JSON Examples

   This appendix contains an example of an instance data tree in JSON
   encoding [RFC7951], instantiating the "ietf-network-inventory" module
   to describe an example of a non-modular network element.
