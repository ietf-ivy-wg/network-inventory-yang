          "body": "@aguoietf Thanks for your input. See some comment of mine in-line below.\n\nI am wondering whether we can start a thread on the IVY WG mailing list to get more feedbacks on this issue.\n\n> An NE is a system and likely will run a Netconf server, so is relevant and we can add a reference in Section 3.2, Network Element, to indicate that. Furthermore,\n\nIMHO, the network inventory model shall not assume nor preclude that the NEs are implementing NETCON/YANG nor RFC7317 (in a similar way as RFC8348). However, as we have done for RFC8348, it is worthwhile checking that the network inventory model works well if the NEs are implementing NETCON/YANG and RFC7317 (as well as RFC8348)\n\nWe can consider adding a section describing how the network inventory model has been build based on RFC7317 and what are the differences and why (something similar to what we have done for RFC8348)\n\n> * Contact represents the administrator contact information for the system (NE). Currently it is not modeled in IVY.\n\nI think it would be good to get some feedbacks (especially from operators) about whether:\n\n- this information is in the scope of the base network inventory model;\n- this information is applicable to any type of NEs, including virtual NEs as well as passive devices (just in case we agree to manage passive devices as passive NEs from an inventory perspective)\n\n> * hostname can be covered by name but name is more generic\n\nAlso in this case, I think it would be good to get some feedbacks (especially from operators) about whether this information is in the scope of the base network inventory model.\n\nAssuming it is in the scope, I think that:\n- the hostname is more specific than the NE and only applicable to managed NEs (e.g., not to passive devices if managed as passive NEs) so it should be added but maybe with some when statement\n- one hostname is sufficient in the context of RFC7317 but in the context of network inventory IMHO we should support a list of hostnames to cover scenarios where a single NE can have multiple management interfaces using different hostnames\n\n> * location is modeled separately\n\nI agree. We may consider documenting this decision somewhere in the draft.\n\n> * The software information defined under the platform container in ietf-system is detailed. software-rev is more generic. Looking also into issue [Does it make sense to have an operating system name (or software name) at device level?\u00a0#44](https://github.com/ietf-ivy-wg/network-inventory-yang/issues/44) , the suggestion is to separate software name from software revision information, instead of putting everything into software-rev.\n> \n\nIMHO, there should not be too much difference on how we model name and release for OS or other SW components.\n\nWe can try to get more feedbacks also from the people working on the SW network inventory model.\n\n> Overall,\n> \n> * Reference to RFC7317 can be added to Section 3.2 NE definition, indicating the NE - system similarity\n\nI agree\n  \n> * Current software version attribute can be used to cover the software specs defined by the system. However there are two options and we need to decide on one:\n>   \n>   * Option 1: use software-rev to encode both the name of the software and the revision\n>   * Option 2: add software-name along with software-rev\n>     No strong opinion but I slightly prefer Option 2.\n> \n\nNo strong opinion also on my side. Just a doubt about how the SW name and revision can be understood by the network controller if RFC8348 is used on the devices.\n",

It can be added by augmentation models when needed.\n- The hostname attribute is already covered by the existing name attribute so no need to add another attribute.\n\nMore discussion is needed regarding the need to add a software-name attribute or to embed the SW name within the software-rev.\n\nThe major concern is on the real need to report the following attributes for the network-element:\n\n```\n           +--ro hardware-rev?         string\n           +--ro software-rev?         string\n           +--ro software-patch-rev*   string\n```\n\nThe alternative approach is to report the OS name and software version within an OS SW component which is defined in [draft-ietf-ivy-network-inventory-software](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-ivy-network-inventory-software)\n\nMore discussion is needed since the original intention was to split the base and the SW inventory models to allow implementing only the base inventory model\n",

          "body": "Regarding the components' software-rev data node, my understanding of the previous discussion is that in most of the cases, the relationship between an HW component and a SW module is 1 HW component contains 0 or 1 SW module (and 0 or 1 FW module) and the base inventory model can manage these cases with the three optional attributes:\n\n```\n                 +--ro hardware-rev?                       string\n                 +--ro software-rev?                       string\n                 ...\n                 +--ro firmware-rev?                       string\n```\n\nAn HW component not associated with any SW or FW module, will instantiate only the hardware-rev data node.\n\nIf the HW component is associated with one (and only one) SW component, the software-rev data node will report the revision of that SW component.\n\nThe base inventory model is not able to cover the cases where the HW component is associated with more than one SW components. In this case, the SW inventory augmentation shall be implemented: the HW component does not instantiate the software-rev data node but it will contain multiple child SW components (one for each contained SW module). The revision of each SW component is reported in the software-rev of that SW component instance.\n\nThe alternative solution is to manage the cases where the HW component is associated with one (and only one) SW component like the other use cases with the HW component having one and only one child SW components.\n\nRegarding the NE's software-rev data node, the issue seems somehow related with #40. My understanding is that the software-rev data node of the NE reports the revision of the NE OS but it would be worthwhile checking if this is a common understanding or just my personal understanding.\n\nAgain one possibility is to report the OS revision as a NE attribute within the base inventory model to cover the scenarios where the NE contains one and only one OS.\n\nAn alternative solution is not to report any OS revision information within the NE but to report a OS SW module component under the NE, using the SW inventory augmentation.\n\nIf the alternative solution is adopted (either for the NE or the component or both), de facto, implementing the SW inventory model together with the base inventory model would become mandatory in almost (if not all) scenarios.\n",

          "body": "> * [x]  [@italobusi](https://github.com/italobusi) prepare some description of the issue for discussion with YANG doctors\n\nThe issue is about the need to report contains-child, as defined in RFC 8348, in addition to the parent and parent-rel-pos information.\n\nLet's consider for example a chassis with four slots. This is the way it will be represented with the current YANG model:\n\n```\n- chassis-A\n- slot-1\n  - parent: chassis-A\n  - parent-rel-pos: 1\n- slot-2\n  - parent: chassis-A\n  - parent-rel-pos: 2\n- slot-3\n  - parent: chassis-A\n  - parent-rel-pos: 3\n- slot-4\n  - parent: chassis-A\n  - parent-rel-pos: 4\n```\n\nIn this case, the list of children component contained by chassis-A is duplicated information:\n\n```\n- module-A\n  - contains-child: [\n    - slot-1\n    - slot-2\n    - slot-3\n    - slot-4\n  ]\n```\n\nThis also looks a circular relationship between client and parent components.\n\nHowever, without the contained children information it seems difficult to model a board which occupies two slots (e.g., slot 2 and slot 3). According to RFC8348, one parent is selected:\n\n```\n- module-B\n  - parent: slot-2\n```\n\nThis information is not sufficient to understand that module-B is occupying two slots nor whether the two slots are slot 2 and slot 3 or slot 1 and  slot 2\n\nIn this case, reporting the contained children would resolve the ambiguity:\n\n```\n- chassis-A\n  - contains-child: [\n    - slot-1\n    - slot-2\n    - slot-3\n    - slot-4\n  ]\n- slot-1\n  - parent: chassis-A\n  - parent-rel-pos: 1\n- slot-2\n  - parent: chassis-A\n  - parent-rel-pos: 2\n  - contains-child: [ module-B ]\n- slot-3\n  - parent: chassis-A\n  - parent-rel-pos: 3\n  - contains-child: [ module-B ]\n- slot-4\n  - parent: chassis-A\n  - parent-rel-pos: 4\n- module-B\n  - parent: slot-2\n```\n\nThe doubt is whether there is an alternative solution which would allow modelling these scenarios avoiding duplication of information when not needed\n",

And for the MPO/break out cable, i am also agree to have a list of destination to describe the multiple breakout ports. And for those ports which there is no transceiver plugged-in, the port still need to be provided in inventory.  We also agree that there could be multiple network elements on a rack. For the site's definition, i am not quite sure, but i also agree that site and equipment room can be both optional.\r\n\r\nChenfang: I have some other understanding for MPO port.

Some navigation capability is needed and the definition of the navigation can be in the scope.\r\n\r\nNeed to clarify that the term inventory in our context is not an unconstrained 'list of anything' but be more precise about the scope of what we are listing. In our context for this initial work, inventory is a representation of the structure of physical things (i.e., not just a list and not all things).\r\n\r\nThere are informational things. Software is an 'informational thing' and it is in the scope of the work (although perhaps not in the first stage). Note that software is not {{Italo: I added not here as I think that that is what you meant to type and it is certainly what I was trying to say}} intended to be the running software which instead is representing the emergent 'functional behavior'.\r\n\r\n- [ ] @nigel-r-davis  prepare some diagrams to show the entities in the scope of our work\r\n\r\nA traditional NE is an assembly of physical things, informational things, the functionality emergent when powered along with the method of access. A virtual NE does not directly have physical components. There are also hybrid NEs with some virtual components and some physical components.\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested also to look at the definitions in draft-palmero-ivy-ps-almo (in particular the asset definition) to see if there are also some concepts that can be used to defined what is in the scope for IVY \r\n\r\n- [ ] Marisol: suggest some improvements to the definitions based on TMF\r\n",

The NE essentially expects an equipment to be inserted. This is a traditional capability and is a rudimentary planning/intent model. Many devices support this capability. It is important to represent this. In TAPI we use the equipment (component) to represent both the expectation and actual. If we were to do that here, the component would have a structure for expectation and a structure for actual along with a mismatch representation capability. We should discuss this in more detail.\r\n",

What is configured which represents the clients' intention is present in intended ds, and if the server cannot apply the configuration successfully (e.g., because it doesn't match the real hardware), the intention won't be present in operational ds, i.e., only what is actual in use is present in operational ds.\r\nA couple of IETF-published YANG has followed this way, e.g., \r\n\r\n- RFC 8348, regarding how the server supports pre-provisioning of hardware:\r\n  `When the server detects a new hardware component, it\r\n           initializes a list entry in the operational state.\r\n\r\n           If the server does not support configuration of hardware\r\n           components, list entries in the operational state are\r\n           initialized with values for all nodes as detected by the\r\n           implementation.\r\n\r\n           Otherwise, this procedure is followed:\r\n\r\n             1. If there is an entry in the '/hardware/component' list\r\n                in the intended configuration with values for the nodes\r\n                'class', 'parent', and 'parent-rel-pos' that are equal\r\n                to the detected values, then the list entry in the\r\n                operational state is initialized with the configured\r\n                values, including the 'name'.\r\n\r\n             2. Otherwise (i.e., there is no matching configuration\r\n                entry), the list entry in the operational state is\r\n                initialized with values for all nodes as detected by\r\n                the implementation.`\r\n\r\n- RFC 8345, section 4.4.10. Supporting Client-Configured and System-Controlled Network Topologies\r\n- RFC 8343, pre-provisioning of interface configuration\r\n  `When a system-controlled interface is created in the operational\r\n   state by the system, the system tries to apply the interface\r\n   configuration in the intended configuration with the same name as the\r\n   new interface.  If no such interface configuration is found, or if\r\n   the configured type does not match the real interface type, the\r\n   system creates the interface without applying explicit configuration.`\r\n\r\n- and also refer to the 8342 itself for the examples of pre-provisioning of interfaces: \r\n  https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8342#appendix-C.3.1 ",

This enables providing federated datastores with a holistic network view without the need for redundant models and copies of the same data across different systems.  Such a capability could become of interest in the future should increasing amounts of management data need to be integrated with network inventory data, for example current state of inventoried elements, data about interfaces, etc.  \r\n\r\nThe proposal was overall well-received, with several attendees contributing to the discussion, involving questions related to scalability, differences between peer-mount and schema-mount, instantiation vs modeling issues.  A 00 draft is in the works and Alex stated that the authors of Peer-Mount are looking for potential coauthors.  \r\n",

Therefore it is fine to define this as an optional element for the network inventory.\r\n\r\nIt has also been proposed to define a new network-inventory top-level container to contain both the list of network elements as well as the list of fibers/cables:\r\n\r\n```\r\n+--rw network-inventory\r\n   +--rw network-elements\r\n   +--rw fibers/cables\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe following assumptions need to be confirmed during the next call:\r\n- define fibers/cables in a network-inventory augmentation model\r\n- define a new network-inventory top-level container on top of the network-elements container\r\n\r\nIt has been agreed that the fibers/cables inventory is not limited to include only fibers/cables between NEs but it may also include, as an implementation decision, option, fibers/cables within different components of the same NE",

      "body": "As per conversations in the IVY working group, the authors of [ps-ALMO](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-palmero-ivy-ps-almo/) and [DMALMO](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-palmero-ivy-dmalmo/) drafts would like to open this issue, to get consensus on the terminology we are using to address asset, feature, and entitlement.\r\n\r\nThe TM Forum (TMF) provides a comprehensive framework, known as Frameworx, which includes a Business Process Framework (eTOM), an Information Framework (SID), and an Application Framework (TAM). These aspects of Frameworx establish a common language and reference for different elements of a service provider's operations, including assets, entitlements, and features.\r\n\r\n- Asset: In the TMF context, an asset is a valuable resource owned or controlled by an organization. This can include physical assets like hardware, logical assets like software, or informational assets like data.\r\n\r\n- Entitlement: In the TMF context, an entitlement usually refers to the rights or privileges that a specific user or customer has within a system or service or even to access a certain feature. These rights or privileges are typically based on the user's subscription or contract terms.\r\n\r\n- Feature: In the TMF context, a feature refers to a specific functionality or capability that a product, service, or system offers. When a customer subscribes to a service, they are given certain entitlements to use specific features.\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\nThe relationship between these elements can be understood as follows:\r\nAn asset (e.g., a network infrastructure, software system, etc.) provides certain features (capabilities or functionalities). The users or customers of the service are given entitlements (rights or privileges) to use these features based on their subscription or contract terms.\r\nFor instance, a software system (asset) may have a data analysis capability (feature), and a user might have an entitlement to use this feature based on their subscription level.\r\n\r\n",

Otherwise, the port component can be reported directly under the module component representing the board. \r\n\r\nEven the 'hole' has no serial-number, it is still need to model the 'hole' because there are multiple 'holes' in the device which need to be numbered and need to distinguish the different types of 'holes' within the network element, which may have different capabilities in terms of SFP modules which can be plugged-id.\r\n\r\nIt has been agreed that the four cases (pluggable transceiver port, non-pluggable transceiver port, empty hole and non-pluggable integrated port) apply to both optical and electrical ports.\r\n\r\nJeff: it is important to highlight that a port is the starting point of a service.\r\nNigel: In TAPI the access port has been defined (considered) as conceptual bridge between the logical model and physical model.\r\n\r\nItalo: I am not sure we need to associate the port with the service or a new object to bridge between the functional view and the hardware/equipment view. The service starts from an LTP and the LTP can be associated with a port.\r\n\r\nIt has been agreed that there is no need to report two components for the Tx and Rx connector. A single 'port' component instance can be used to report the combination of the Tx and Rx connectors. In case of bidirectional connectors (e.g., a pin terminating a bidirectional fiber or an RJ-45 connector), a single 'port' component instance can be used to report the bidirectional connector.\r\n\r\nJeff: for me, on a pluggable, the port is the connector or the combination of the Tx and Rx connectors\r\n\r\nIt was highlighted that the SFP module and the connector/connectors pair can be modelled as a single 'port' component. In this case, there  is no need for a new component class (the 'transceiver' component class in the slides) and no need to differentiate in the model between the non-pluggable transceiver port and the non-pluggable integrated port.\r\n\r\nJeff disagreed not have a specific component for transceiver.\r\n\r\nThis issue needs further discussion.\r\n\r\nThe slides propose to model the 'hole', where an SFP module can be plugged-in, as a 'port' component instead of as a 'container' component\r\n\r\nThere was no agreement on whether the 'hole', where an SFP module can be plugged-in, should be modelled as a 'port' component or as an holder component of a different class (e.g., 'container' component class or as a new component class)\r\n\r\n- [x] @italobusi  send a mail to the IVY WG to gather more feedbacks also from other operators on how to model the 'hole' where an SPF module can be plugged-in\r\n",

Supporters of one option can reply to the mail with their opinion about the advantages of the option they prefer.\r\n\r\nThe objective is to get a decision between option 1 and option 2 before the next call (May 22, 2024).\r\n\r\nIf option 2 is selected, we can later discuss the pros&cons of reusing the 'container' component class or defining a new component class, such as the 'cage' as proposed by BBF.\r\n\r\nNigel thinks that the hole is present with or without anything plugged-in and its capabilities have to be reported. Even if some holes are specialize for a single type of SFP, nothing precludes holes that can have different types of SFPs or with more than one 'port'.\r\nAn 'hole' can also host some other type of module (e.g., a memory module) without any external connector, not necessarily a transceiver.\r\n\r\nAihua reported the use case to retrieve all the capabilities of a board, including the empty 'holes', pluggable ports and non-pluggable ports.\r\n\r\nAccording to Nigel the capability of the cards should be known by the controller before the card is plugged-in either through offline information or by some capability model.\r\n\r\nPrasenjit reported that if there is a mismatch between the capabilities of the 'hole' and what it is plugged-in, an alarm should be raised.\r\n\r\nAihua reported that in the published BBF the 'transceiver-link' component is not used to report a optical connector but the 'transceiver' function within an SFP module (which is modelled in BBF as a 'transceiver' component). There are scenarios where a single SFP module can contain more than on 'transceiver' functions.\r\n\r\nIt has been highlighted that the current approach in IVY WG is to decouple the functional view from the hardware view. The functional view of the 'transceiver' is already modelled in the optical impairments topology and equally applies to the 'transceivers' hosted in an SFP module as well as those hosted on a 'transponder card'.\r\n\r\nIt may be worthwhile having some examples of the PON possible configurations to check how the base model can be used to model the PON port, especially those at the OLT.\r\n",

With this approach there is no need to define a container component class (as in RFC8348) because there is no need to report the empty slots nor the empty SFP holes in the list of installed components.\r\n\r\nConcerns have been raised about how the following scenarios can be supported without defining a container component class:\r\n- boards which occupy more than one slot\r\n- logical partitioning (by software-only configuration) of one slot into sub-slots\r\n\r\nIt was also noted that reporting the available slots and SFP holes only in the capability model and not in the component list would make the implementation of the capability model mandatory when reporting the empty slots and SFP holes is required.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nBased on this discussion, we can summarize the possible solutions with four options, which differs in:\r\n- whether it is consistent or not with the OpenConfig approach\r\n- whether it is using or not the RFC8348 container component class to model the slots\r\n- whether it has or not consistent models for the slots and the SFP holes\r\n- whether the implementation of the capability model is required or not to report the empty slots and SFP holes\r\n\r\nOption 1:\r\n\r\n```\r\n+-- chassis\r\n    +-- container                 // slot: empty when there is no child module component\r\n        +-- module                // board\r\n            +-- container         // SFP hole (only for pluggable ports): empty when there is no child module component\r\n                +-- module        // transceiver(s) module (optional for non-pluggable ports)\r\n                    +-- port      // non-MPO port\r\n```\r\n\r\n- not consistent with the OpenConfig approach\r\n- use the RFC8348 container component class to model the slots\r\n- consistent models for the slots and the SFP holes\r\n- implementation of the capability model is not required to report the empty slots and SFP holes\r\n\r\nOption 2:\r\n\r\n```\r\n+-- chassis\r\n    +-- module                    // empty slot or board\r\n        +-- port                  // empty SFP hole or port (MPO or non-MPO and pluggable or non-pluggable port)\r\n            +-- transceiver       // transceiver(s) module (optional for non-pluggable ports)\r\n```\r\n\r\n- consistent with the OpenConfig approach\r\n- do not use the RFC8348 container component class to model the slots\r\n- consistent models for the slots and the SFP holes\r\n- implementation of the capability model is not required to report the empty slots and SFP holes\r\n\r\nOption 3:\r\n\r\n```\r\n+-- chassis\r\n    +-- module                    // board\r\n        +-- module                // transceiver(s) module (optional for non-pluggable ports)\r\n            +-- port              // non-MPO port\r\n```\r\n\r\n- not consistent with the OpenConfig approach\r\n- do not use the RFC8348 container component class to model the slots\r\n- consistent models for the slots and the SFP holes\r\n- implementation of the capability model is required to report the empty slots and SFP holes\r\n\r\nOption 4:\r\n\r\n```\r\n+-- chassis\r\n    +-- container                 // slot: empty when there is no child module component\r\n        +-- module                // board\r\n            +-- port              // empty SFP hole or (pluggable or non-pluggable) non-MPO port\r\n                +-- transceiver   // transceiver(s) module (optional for non-pluggable ports)\r\n```\r\n\r\n- partially consistent with the OpenConfig approach (only for the ports but not for the slots)\r\n- use the RFC8348 container component class to model the slots\r\n- not consistent models for the slots and the SFP holes\r\n- implementation of the capability model is not required to report the empty slots and SFP holes\r\n\r\n- [ ] @italobusi ask the following questions to the IVY WG\r\n\r\n1) How important is to maintain consistency with the OpenConfig approach in IVY WG?\r\n2) How important is to support the following scenarios (which can be supported using the RFC8348 container component class to model the slots)?\r\n   - boards which occupy more than one slot\r\n   - logical partitioning (by software-only configuration) of one slot into sub-slots\r\n3) How important is to have consistent models for the slots and the SFP holes?\r\n4) How important is to implementation of the capability model required or not to report the empty slots and SFP holes?\r\n\r\n",

My understanding is that you are proposing to:\r\n\r\n1. model the \"MPO connector\" as one component instance of class 'port' and to define the container groups under the component with some when statement to make it applicable only to components of type 'port'\r\n\r\n2. define an entry in the group list to represent the set of lanes/pins which are associated with a single client interface (an entry in the group is something similar to the TAPI access-port)\r\n\r\n   For example, considering example 5 in slide 10 of [port-examples-09.pptx](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/15905050/port-examples-09.pptx), there will be M groups where the group 1 (associated with client 1 interface) has K lanes while group M (associated with client M interface) has one lane\r\n\r\nIs my understanding correct?\r\n",

Therefore this type of name cannot be used as a key of a YANG list\r\n\r\nThere are also some cases where it is very hard to guarantee uniqueness of the names (e.g., when there are multiple controllers creating entries in the list): https://github.com/tsaad-dev/te/issues/50)\r\n\r\nTo avoid these issues the keys of the list can better be URIs or UUIDs\r\n\r\nTo give more implementation freedom we have agreed to define the key as a string which may or not match with the name, the UUID,  or the URI:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ietf-ivy-wg/network-inventory-yang/blob/main/minutes/minutes-2024-01-17.md\r\n\r\nWe have proposed to add some clarification text to the I-D: see PR #65 \r\n\r\nCo-Authored-By: YuChaode <yuchaode@huawei.com>\r\n",

This looks like the same as case 1 in https://github.com/ietf-ivy-wg/network-inventory-yang/issues/64#issuecomment-2359312360\r\n\r\nIMHO, using the stack component is not needed but also not precluded as show for case 3 in https://github.com/ietf-ivy-wg/network-inventory-yang/issues/64#issuecomment-2359312360. However, my feeling, is that this would be more useful when there is a need to report more than one group of chassis (stacks) within the same network element",

      "body": "My thoughts and Sergio's comments labeled with [SB]\r\n\r\nThe issue is finding terminology that will be agreeable to network equipment vendors, data center people, and computer hardware people.  The idea is simple, but can be mapped onto different terminology.\r\n\r\nFor example.\r\n\r\nA rack is a metal frame that may or may not contain electrical components that holds a chassis.\r\n\r\nA standard rack holding something like a Cisco 8804 chassis looks like this.\r\n\r\n![download](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f52983c7-d6dd-4e5a-8da5-716a02daa1aa)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe big holes you see in the picture above are slots.  There are slots on the back as well.  A slot can accept various modules, trays, or cards.  Some modules and/or cards can have daughter cards can be connected to the module or card.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nLooking at the Network Inventory YANG terminology.\r\n\r\nThe rack, chassis and slots above are (as TMF puts them) holders. \r\n\r\n[SB>] YES the TMF separation between \u201cholders\u201d and \u201cequipment\u201d groups  is also in our document\r\n\r\nAn example of a sub-chassis could be a tray that holds other components (like fans).  In the Network Inventory YANG the term Board is (I think) a module or a card. \r\n\r\n[SB>] In our model a board is defined as\u201d ianahw:module\u201d , there is no distinction unfortunately from module to card/board.\r\n\r\nUsually, modules are things like fans or power, so if we are modeling that we will need to differentiate a module from a card (so calling both of those board is probably wrong). \r\n\r\n[SB>]  Fan is considered as a specific card, it has a definition specific, not as ianahw:module .\r\n\r\nThere is a differentiation between cards as well (at least in Cisco-land).  There are \u201cline cards\u201d and \u201cfabric cards\u201d.  A line card has ports on it and in the case of optical pluggables a line card may have slots to accept pluggables. I don\u2019t know if that is what is intended by the \u201csub-slot\u201d terminology, but it could work since a pluggable would be considered a module that fits into a cards' sub-slot.  At least that is one interpretation. \r\n\r\n[SB>] In this case we would have a definition for sub-slot that should be \u201ca slot of a line-card hosting an optical pluggable\u201d\r\n\r\nA \u201cfabric card\u201d is a card that \u201cline cards\u201d and sometimes modules plug into.  But here the \"sub-slot\" terminology doesn't really work very well, because the \"sub-slot\" on the \"fabric card\" is not inline with the slot the \"fabric card\" is in.  \r\n\r\nWhat needs to be made clear is whether or not a \u201csub-slot\u201d is simply a holder or if a \u201csub-slot\u201d can be used for something like an optical pluggable.\r\n\r\n[SB>] It can be used as a holder for an optical pluggable in my view.\r\n\r\nI think a couple of examples to see what the instance data would look would help.\r\n\r\nLooking at M.3100.  I would say recursive not circular.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nA rack is made up of bays\r\n\r\nA chassis is held in some number of bays of a rack depending on the size of the chassis.\r\n\r\nA chassis has slots (or physical places to put things)\r\n\r\nA chassis slot holds a \"circuit pack\" (which can be a line card, fabric card, computer, power, fans etc.)\r\n\r\nA line card can also accept pluggables\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI think leveraging M.3100 and mapping the terminology is a good exercise.  Things will get more interesting when the data center people show up and want to start talking about blades.\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @samans in https://github.com/ietf-ivy-wg/network-inventory-yang/pull/75#discussion_r1909574652_\r\n            ",

More feedbacks from other operators are welcome\n\n- [ ] @ju7ien: trigger some discussion in the IVY WG mailing list\n\nNote 1: with integrated OTs it is assumed an hardware configuration where the OT and the WSS cards are different  cards (usually on different shelves) which belong to the same NE and connected trough an external cable (and not through the backplane)\n\nNote 2: as a consequence, there is a requirement to report within the passive inventory both intra-NE and inter-NE cables\n\nNigel: Of course, like all passive inventory, the representation of the cable is (often) a statement of expectation, as the cable cannot be detected. Even where there is some mechanism for basic detection, the detector may not be functioning..\n\nSergio: Related to what Jeff is indicating about access-port in TAPI and the relationship between logical and physical model by access-port, we can say that in IETF we are on the same path with inventory-topology draft in which we make a reference between TP (termination point) and a port in inventory, where we abstract TP, and we make reference between a node to NE in the inventory, NE where we abstract node in topology model. \n\nNigel: Note that the TAPI solution allows reference from the TP equivalent to the physical environment via AccessPort which provides a fine grain reference to connectors and pins where relevant (the solution allows various degrees of detail including a reference to a whole connector where all pins are used etc.). Whilst the full flexibility may not be needed at this point, it is important to ensure that we design the solution to enable enhancement to the full flexibility.\n",

Updating all the repositories to use the updated version of the template from Martin Thomson was quite straightforward because no changes were done on the files defined there. I am afraid that if we make changes to the core files, that work would have been more painful.\n\nMy preference is therefore to have an updated template which will make these enhancements available to all the repositories.\n\nAlternative, if possible, we can create a new template forking from Martin Thomson's template and adding pyang validation checks. Then we just need to synch this fork with any update of Martin Thomson's template and not all the github repositories.",

The cables between them can be reported in the passive inventory model.\n\nIn the optical NEs, the different chassis have different role in the hierarchy where the main shelf is the chassis/shelf providing access to the management system.

However, this different is not inherently technology-specific but just common implementation options and the models should support both regardless of the technology domain.\n\nNote that this difference will be modelled in the first version of the base inventory model since everything is RO (the configuration of the main shelf can only be performed at device level and at the network level). However, this difference may become relevant in a future RFC updating the first version of the base inventory model.\n\nThe questions for discussion are:\n- is there a need to report, within the network inventory, which the role of each chassis (main or subtended)\n- if yes, how to represent this information: as a flag indicating the main chassis or as a role enumeration (main, subtended) indicating the role\n\n- [x] @italobusi : check with the IVY WG mailing list for feedbacks",

      "body": "Slot is not a component. It has no independent life (it is not separable from the equipment (chassis etc.)), It does not have a serial number and must have the same manufacturer as the thing it is a slot in. It does not have software or firmware and does not have any substance (as I have explained on several occasions before). I have not come across a model that treats slot as an equal to a board before. In TM Forum, we did originally mix up holder and equipment where a holder was a type of equipment, but we subsequently corrected that (as per ITU-T G.7711).\n\nI propose the addition of an optional slot list to the component structure with the few properties that a slot actually has. I propose that this is the only approach to representation of slots and the slot as a component is not allowed in the standard usage.\n\nThis then means that a component is in a slot (or slots) of a component and hence references the slot leaf  (leaves) of the component. This can be a direct reference or an implicit list relationship. (better to cover the multi-slot occupancy challenge).\n\nLooking at component, the lines marked <<<<<<< below is not relevant for a slot (i.e., most of them!).\n\n           +--rw components\n              +--rw component* [component-id]\n                 +--rw component-id                        string\n                 +--ro class                               union\n                 +--ro uuid?                               yang:uuid <<<<<<<<<<<<<\n                 +--rw name?                               string\n                 +--rw description?                        string\n                 +--rw alias?                              string\n                 +--ro hardware-rev?                       string <<<<<<<<<<<<<\n                 +--ro software-rev?                       string <<<<<<<<<<<<<\n                 +--ro software-patch-rev*                 string <<<<<<<<<<<<<\n                 +--ro mfg-name?                           string <<<<<<<<<<<<<\n                 +--ro mfg-date?                                  <<<<<<<<<<<<<\n                 |       yang:date-and-time\n                 +--ro serial-number?                      string <<<<<<<<<<<<<\n                 +--ro product-name?                       string <<<<<<<<<<<<<\n                 +--ro firmware-rev?                       string <<<<<<<<<<<<<\n                 +--ro part-number?                        string <<<<<<<<<<<<<\n                 +--ro asset-id?                           string <<<<<<<<<<<<<\n                 +--ro child-component-ref\n                 +--ro parent-rel-pos?                     int32\n                 +--ro parent?\n                 |       -> ../../component/component-id\n                 +--ro is-fru?                             boolean <<<<<<<<<<<<<\n                 +--ro uri*                                inet:uri <<<<<<<<<<<<<\n                 +--ro chassis-specific-info <<<<<<<<<<<<<\n                 +--ro slot-specific-info\n                 +--ro board-specific-info <<<<<<<<<<<<<\n                 +--ro port-specific-info <<<<<<<<<<<<<\n                 +--ro transceiver-module-specific-info <<<<<<<<<<<<<\n                    +--ro breakout-channels!\n                       +--ro breakout-channel* [channel-id]\n                          +--ro channel-id    uint8\n\nTaking the relevant attributes some are then no longer relevant if this is to be converted to a dedicated slot structure.\n\n           +--rw components\n              +--rw component* [component-id]\n                 +--rw component-id                        string\n                 +--ro class                               union <<<<<<<<<<<<<\n                 +--rw name?                               string\n                 +--rw description?                        string\n                 +--rw alias?                              string\n                 +--ro child-component-ref\n                 +--ro parent-rel-pos?                     int32\n                 +--ro parent?                            <<<<<<<<<<<<<\n                 |       -> ../../component/component-id\n                 +--ro slot-specific-info\n\nThe slot structure then becomes\u2026 (some properties still look rather an overkill for slot)\u2026\n\n           +--rw slots?\n              +--rw slot* [component-id]\n                 +--rw slot-id                        string\n                 +--rw name?                               string\n                 +--rw description?                        string \n                 +--rw alias?                              string\n                 +--ro child-component-ref\n                 +--ro parent-rel-pos?                     int32\n                 +--ro slot-specific-info\n\nThe above structure then becomes an optional part of the component.

This allows for preplanning. In a planning application the inventory has a time dimension and requires multiple things in a slot over time. We will need to add that later.\n\n",

          "body": "**Introduction**\nThe discussion relates to navigation from a slot to the contained component and from a component to the containing slot. We may conclude that we only want one of these navigations in the model for interface efficiency. If we conclude on only one then the most efficient is the navigation from a component to the slot(s) that contains it (as when the component is inserted in the slot, the slot does not need to also be updated).\n\nApologies, the YANG is a bit rough.\n\n**Navigation from component to containing slots**\nThis is the primary approach in the ivy model today. This is the preferred approach.\n\n                 +--ro parent?\n                 |       -> ../../component/component-id\n\n... which is \n                \"The identifier of the component that physically\n                contains this component.\"\n\nThis navigation is from component to component. As the slot moves to be a subordinate element of a component, we now need to reference a slot in a component. Note that a component may occupy several slots so this should have been a list.\n\nOne approach is to keep the reference to a component as is (continuing to support the non-FRU component with no change and then add a reference to the slot(s) as a list element.\n\nA basic method for this is to add a slot list element after parent....\n\n                 +--ro parent?\n                 |       -> ../../component/component-id\n                 +--ro slot*                                string\n\nIt may be relevant to indicate the slot role (whether it is simply occupied or actually connected to the component in it. This is information that can be easily derived from the spec of the slots and the spec of the thing plugged in the slots so we may consider this unnecessary.\n\nWe could make the slot list more formally related to the id(s) of the slot(s) in the compoent and provide a \"role\" statement\n\n\n         container parent {\n           leaf component {\n              type leafref {\n                path \"../../component/component-id\";\n                require-instance false;\n              }\n           }\n           list slot {\n             key \"slot-id\"\n             leaf slot-ref {\n               type leafref {\n                 path \"../../component/component-id/slot/slot-id\";\n               require-instance false;\n               }\n               leaf role{\n                 type xxx;\n\n                  Will be an enum with connected, occupied, blocked or similar.\n               }\n             }\n           }\n\n**Navigation from slot to contained component**\n\nA slot can only be occupied by one component. The reference is simply to component from a slot list element.\n\nThis is a non-preferred orientation of navigation as it is less efficient on the interface. When a component arrives to occupy a slot, the slot needs to be updated with occupancy information (a notification) and the new component needs to be created (a separate notification). \n\nIn the preferred navigation all information is contained in the notification of the component creation including the slot that it occupies. The component with the occupied slot does not need to be updated.\n\n\n",

The SW inventory model has been designed to cover these complex scenarios\n\nTwo concerns with removing the SW information from the base inventory model:\n- making mandatory to implement the SW inventory model also in simple scenarios where there is only one OS for the NE and one SW module running on the component\n- the SW inventory model is re-using the component list defined in the base inventory model to model SW modules\n\nModelling a NE/component with a single module using the SW inventory model would make the solution more uniform and consistent with little overhead\n\nIt was also pointed out the serial-number attribute is not applicable to SW modules\n\n- [ ] @nigel-r-davis @prmanna review the latest I-D on SW inventory model and evaluate the impact of removing the SW attributes from the base model\n",

AccessPort is a logical abstraction of pins in a connector that support a single signal flow. I will provide definitions from TAPI.\n\nI will aim to provide an improved definition in ivy for port and a definition for connector.\n\nThe relevant current definition (where port is mentioned) are:\n\nPort: : A component where networking traffic can be received and/or transmitted, e.g., by attaching networking cables. : In case of pluggable ports, the port may be empty when no transceiver module is plugged in.\n\nPhysical interface: : An interface associated to a physical port. A physical interface is always in the lowest layer of the interface stack.\n\nLogical interface: : An interface which is not associated to a physical port.\n\nBreakout Port: : A port is usually associated with a single physical interface. A breakout port is a port which is broken down and associated into multiple physical interfaces. Those physical interfaces can have the same or different speeds and the same or different number of breakout channels.\n\nTrunk Port: : A trunk port is a port which is associated with one and only physical interface.\n\nPort Breakout: : The configuration of a breakout port.\n",

For example, if the software version is 8.2.1, the patched version is 8.2.1.P1. Can the description of the software-rev field be relaxed to say that it denotes either the software-rev or a patched version of the image (and remove the software-patch-rev field)\n- a possible option is to move the software-patch-rev under a presence container to indicate whether the software patches are explicitly reported or implicitly reported as part of the software name/rev\n\nIt has been noted that the software revision and patches are optional and therefore a vendor can decide to report the software patch version as part of the software name or revision. There is no need for a presence container to avoid ambiguity since this is a vendor choice.\n\nIt is therefore preferred not to change the model and just improve the descriptions to allow these implementation choices.\n\n- [x] @italobusi update the description of the software revision and patches to allow these implementation options\n\nIt has also been noted that the SW inventory model can extend the base inventory model to report additional information for the SW patches (e.g., the time the patch has been installed).\n\nIt has been agreed to change the list of software patches from leaf-list to a list which can be used as an augmentation target by the SW inventory model:\n\nOLD\n\n```\n           |  +--ro patch-rev*   string\n```\nNEW\n\n```\n           |  +--ro patch* [revision]\n           |     +--ro revision?    string\n```\n\n- [x] @italobusi discuss these comments and proposal with the IVY WG mailing list\n- [x] @italobusi update the  software patches as a list instead of as a leaf-list\n",

If a vendor needs a deeper hierarchy, the SW inventory extension can always add parent/child relationships.\n\nI am not sure we have clear definitions to distinguish between version, release, patch and revision ...\n\nLet me try to summarize what I have understood are the possible scenarios, borrowing from Mahesh's example; \n\n> [mj] In cases such as ours (Arrcus, and I have seen this with other vendors also), the software patch version/rev is part of the software name (or rev) and is not a separate field. For example, if the software version is 8.2.1, the patched version is 8.2.1.P1. Can the description of the software-rev field be relaxed to say that it denotes either the software-rev or a patched version of the image (and remove the software-patch-rev field)?\n\nAs far as I have understood, the comment, three implementations are possible on the device\n\nOne implementation option is when the device reports three fields:\n- SW name: \"FOO\"\n- SW release: \"8.2.1\"\n- SW patch: \"P1\"\n\nIn this case, the network controller has all the information to properly report:\n\n```\n{\n  \"software-rev\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"FOO\",\n      \"revision\": \"8.2.1\",\n      \"patch\": [\n        {\n          \"revision\": \"P1\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nWith the alternative proposal from Bo, my understanding is that the network controller could report:\n\n```\n{\n  \"software-rev\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"FOO\",\n      \"revision\": [\n        {\n          \"version\": \"8.2.1\",\n          \"type\": \"revision\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"version\": \"P1\",\n          \"type\": \"patch\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nAnother implementation option is when the device reports only tow fields:\n- SW name: \"FOO\"\n- SW release: \"8.2.1.P1\"\n\nIn this case the network controller has not enough information to split the patch information from the SW patch. The updated descriptions, proposed in PR #135, are intended to allow the network controller to report:\n\n```\n{\n  \"software-rev\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"FOO\",\n      \"revision\": \"8.2.1,P1\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nIt is worth noting that the patch list can be omitted/empty it two cases:\n1. when the software revision embeds the software patch information\n1. when there is no patch installed\n\nIn the [2025-09-17 Base Network Inventory weekly call](https://github.com/ietf-ivy-wg/network-inventory-yang/wiki/minutes-2025-09-17) it was agreed that there is no need to no need for a presence container to avoid ambiguity since this is a vendor choice.\n\nWith the alternative proposal from Bo, my understanding is that the network controller could report:\n\n```\n{\n  \"software-rev\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"FOO\",\n      \"revision\": [\n        {\n          \"version\": \"8.2.1.P1\",\n          \"type\": \"revision and patch\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nA third implementation option is when the device reports only one field:\n- SW name: \"FOO R8.2.1.P1\"\n\nIn this case the network controller has not enough information to split the release and patch information from the SW name. The updated descriptions, proposed in PR #135, are intended to allow the network controller to report:\n\n```\n{\n  \"software-rev\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"FOO R8.2.1.P1\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n\n",

It seems that there are no requirements to allow multiple SW revisions being configured to be active for the same SW module (on the same component) at the same time. Moreover, if multiple SW revisions and patches are listed to, it would not be clear which patches apply to which SW revision.\n\nIn order not to delay the WG LC, it has been agreed not to change the model now. However, a WG LC comment can be submitted for further discussion within the IVY WG, if needed.\n",

The component \"class\" is defined as a union between the hardware class identity, defined in \"iana-hardware\", and the \"non-hardware\" identity, defined in this document. Attributes related to specific class of component can be found in the component-specific-info structure.\" In the previous discussion, Italo suggested to remove class attribute and different types of components can be identified by the component-specific structure. I raised a concern that it is hard to do a filtering if there is not a class attribute. So I prefer to keeping class attribute still in this draft at first, and whetherto keep it or not still needs more discussions.  ",

              "body": "My thoughts and Sergio's comments labeled with [SB]\r\n\r\nThe issue is finding terminology that will be agreeable to network equipment vendors, data center people, and computer hardware people.  The idea is simple, but can be mapped onto different terminology.\r\n\r\nFor example.\r\n\r\nA rack is a metal frame that may or may not contain electrical components that holds a chassis.\r\n\r\nA standard rack holding something like a Cisco 8804 chassis looks like this.\r\n\r\n![download](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f52983c7-d6dd-4e5a-8da5-716a02daa1aa)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe big holes you see in the picture above are slots.  There are slots on the back as well.  A slot can accept various modules, trays, or cards.  Some modules and/or cards can have daughter cards can be connected to the module or card.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nLooking at the Network Inventory YANG terminology.\r\n\r\nThe rack, chassis and slots above are (as TMF puts them) holders. \r\n\r\n[SB>] YES the TMF separation between \u201cholders\u201d and \u201cequipment\u201d groups  is also in our document\r\n\r\nAn example of a sub-chassis could be a tray that holds other components (like fans).  In the Network Inventory YANG the term Board is (I think) a module or a card. \r\n\r\n[SB>] In our model a board is defined as\u201d ianahw:module\u201d , there is no distinction unfortunately from module to card/board.\r\n\r\nUsually, modules are things like fans or power, so if we are modeling that we will need to differentiate a module from a card (so calling both of those board is probably wrong). \r\n\r\n[SB>]  Fan is considered as a specific card, it has a definition specific, not as ianahw:module .\r\n\r\nThere is a differentiation between cards as well (at least in Cisco-land).  There are \u201cline cards\u201d and \u201cfabric cards\u201d.  A line card has ports on it and in the case of optical pluggables a line card may have slots to accept pluggables. I don\u2019t know if that is what is intended by the \u201csub-slot\u201d terminology, but it could work since a pluggable would be considered a module that fits into a cards' sub-slot.  At least that is one interpretation. \r\n\r\n[SB>] In this case we would have a definition for sub-slot that should be \u201ca slot of a line-card hosting an optical pluggable\u201d\r\n\r\nA \u201cfabric card\u201d is a card that \u201cline cards\u201d and sometimes modules plug into.  But here the \"sub-slot\" terminology doesn't really work very well, because the \"sub-slot\" on the \"fabric card\" is not inline with the slot the \"fabric card\" is in.  \r\n\r\nWhat needs to be made clear is whether or not a \u201csub-slot\u201d is simply a holder or if a \u201csub-slot\u201d can be used for something like an optical pluggable.\r\n\r\n[SB>] It can be used as a holder for an optical pluggable in my view.\r\n\r\nI think a couple of examples to see what the instance data would look would help.\r\n\r\nLooking at M.3100.  I would say recursive not circular.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nA rack is made up of bays\r\n\r\nA chassis is held in some number of bays of a rack depending on the size of the chassis.\r\n\r\nA chassis has slots (or physical places to put things)\r\n\r\nA chassis slot holds a \"circuit pack\" (which can be a line card, fabric card, computer, power, fans etc.)\r\n\r\nA line card can also accept pluggables\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI think leveraging M.3100 and mapping the terminology is a good exercise.  Things will get more interesting when the data center people show up and want to start talking about blades.",

Whilst a pure definition of physical, with no functional aspects, would be preferable, the word is misused extensively across the industry and hence we have to align with that misuse.\r\n",

The physical interface term can be used to represent the interface in the lowest layer of the interface stack associated a physical port.\r\n\r\n- [x] @italobusi add some note to the draft clarifying that channelizing an interface (e.g., an Ethernet interface) into multiple logical sub-interfaces (e.g., VLAN interfaces) is not port breakout and outside the scope of the inventory models.\r\n\r\nIt has been clarified that the intention for defining the concept of breakout channels is to make the model more flexible and independent from the technology (e.g., optical) and the specific implementations. In case of 400G-DR4 implementations, the breakout channels map 1:1 with the line channels: the intention is to describe this mapping in an appendix (text still to be developed).\r\n\r\nIn the 400G-DR4 examples, there are two host channels associated with a single line channel. However, it is not possible to associate two different interfaces with two different host channels if they are associated with the same line channel.\r\n\r\nWhile the association between the physical interfaces, host channels and line channels is relevant for device configuration (and supported by OpenConfig), from network inventory perspective, only the associations between the physical interfaces (abstracted as physical LTPs) and the line channels is relevant. Therefore the line channels can be reported in the network inventory model as breakout channels.\r\n\r\nThe appendix with the examples of breakout configuration can be completed in the next update: issue #93  has been created to complete the example\r\n\r\nAgreed to review the PR before the next call (February 26, 2025) with the objective to be able to merge it before IETF 122 cut-off deadline\r\n",
