Complex configurations where an HW component can support multiple SW versions can be modelled using the SW inventory extension model: in this case, an HW-only component instance will have only the hardware-rev and it will contain one or more SW-only child component instances, which will have only the software-rev attribute\r\n\r\nAgreement to keep only onw software-rev attribute per component\r\n\r\nAgreement to add the software-patch-rev attribute (as a list) also for network elements\r\n\r\n- [ ] @YuChaode  update the YANG model and the draft as agreed during the call\r\n",

And for the MPO/break out cable, i am also agree to have a list of destination to describe the multiple breakout ports. And for those ports which there is no transceiver plugged-in, the port still need to be provided in inventory.  We also agree that there could be multiple network elements on a rack. For the site's definition, i am not quite sure, but i also agree that site and equipment room can be both optional.\r\n\r\nChenfang: I have some other understanding for MPO port. Can be discussed in next week's meeting.\r\n\r\nIt is all aligned that we will not do update on the inventory draft's texting for the upcoming IETF 113 meeting, because of the discussion of generic model and CU proposed model is not finished.\r\n",

Some navigation capability is needed and the definition of the navigation can be in the scope.\r\n\r\nNeed to clarify that the term inventory in our context is not an unconstrained 'list of anything' but be more precise about the scope of what we are listing. In our context for this initial work, inventory is a representation of the structure of physical things (i.e., not just a list and not all things).\r\n\r\nThere are informational things. Software is an 'informational thing' and it is in the scope of the work (although perhaps not in the first stage). Note that software is not {{Italo: I added not here as I think that that is what you meant to type and it is certainly what I was trying to say}} intended to be the running software which instead is representing the emergent 'functional behavior'.\r\n\r\n- [ ] @nigel-r-davis  prepare some diagrams to show the entities in the scope of our work\r\n\r\nA traditional NE is an assembly of physical things, informational things, the functionality emergent when powered along with the method of access. A virtual NE does not directly have physical components. There are also hybrid NEs with some virtual components and some physical components.\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested also to look at the definitions in draft-palmero-ivy-ps-almo (in particular the asset definition) to see if there are also some concepts that can be used to defined what is in the scope for IVY \r\n\r\n- [ ] Marisol: suggest some improvements to the definitions based on TMF\r\n",

The NE essentially expects an equipment to be inserted. This is a traditional capability and is a rudimentary planning/intent model. Many devices support this capability. It is important to represent this. In TAPI we use the equipment (component) to represent both the expectation and actual. If we were to do that here, the component would have a structure for expectation and a structure for actual along with a mismatch representation capability.

What is configured which represents the clients' intention is present in intended ds, and if the server cannot apply the configuration successfully (e.g., because it doesn't match the real hardware), the intention won't be present in operational ds, i.e., only what is actual in use is present in operational ds.\r\nA couple of IETF-published YANG has followed this way, e.g., \r\n\r\n- RFC 8348, regarding how the server supports pre-provisioning of hardware:\r\n  `When the server detects a new hardware component, it\r\n           initializes a list entry in the operational state.\r\n\r\n           If the server does not support configuration of hardware\r\n           components, list entries in the operational state are\r\n           initialized with values for all nodes as detected by the\r\n           implementation.\r\n\r\n           Otherwise, this procedure is followed:\r\n\r\n             1. If there is an entry in the '/hardware/component' list\r\n                in the intended configuration with values for the nodes\r\n                'class', 'parent', and 'parent-rel-pos' that are equal\r\n                to the detected values, then the list entry in the\r\n                operational state is initialized with the configured\r\n                values, including the 'name'.\r\n\r\n             2. Otherwise (i.e., there is no matching configuration\r\n                entry), the list entry in the operational state is\r\n                initialized with values for all nodes as detected by\r\n                the implementation.`\r\n\r\n- RFC 8345, section 4.4.10. Supporting Client-Configured and System-Controlled Network Topologies\r\n- RFC 8343, pre-provisioning of interface configuration\r\n  `When a system-controlled interface is created in the operational\r\n   state by the system, the system tries to apply the interface\r\n   configuration in the intended configuration with the same name as the\r\n   new interface.  If no such interface configuration is found, or if\r\n   the configured type does not match the real interface type, the\r\n   system creates the interface without applying explicit configuration.`\r\n\r\n- and also refer to the 8342 itself for the examples of pre-provisioning of interfaces: \r\n  https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8342#appendix-C.3.1 ",

This enables providing federated datastores with a holistic network view without the need for redundant models and copies of the same data across different systems.  Such a capability could become of interest in the future should increasing amounts of management data need to be integrated with network inventory data, for example current state of inventoried elements, data about interfaces, etc.  \r\n\r\nThe proposal was overall well-received, with several attendees contributing to the discussion, involving questions related to scalability, differences between peer-mount and schema-mount, instantiation vs modeling issues.  A 00 draft is in the works and Alex stated that the authors of Peer-Mount are looking for potential coauthors.  \r\n",

These aspects of Frameworx establish a common language and reference for different elements of a service provider's operations, including assets, entitlements, and features.\r\n\r\n- Asset: In the TMF context, an asset is a valuable resource owned or controlled by an organization. This can include physical assets like hardware, logical assets like software, or informational assets like data.\r\n\r\n- Entitlement: In the TMF context, an entitlement usually refers to the rights or privileges that a specific user or customer has within a system or service or even to access a certain feature. These rights or privileges are typically based on the user's subscription or contract terms.\r\n\r\n- Feature: In the TMF context, a feature refers to a specific functionality or capability that a product, service, or system offers. When a customer subscribes to a service, they are given certain entitlements to use specific features.\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\nThe relationship between these elements can be understood as follows:\r\nAn asset (e.g., a network infrastructure, software system, etc.) provides certain features (capabilities or functionalities). The users or customers of the service are given entitlements (rights or privileges) to use these features based on their subscription or contract terms.\r\nFor instance, a software system (asset) may have a data analysis capability (feature), and a user might have an entitlement to use this feature based on their subscription level.\r\n\r\n",

Otherwise, the port component can be reported directly under the module component representing the board. \r\n\r\nEven the 'hole' has no serial-number, it is still need to model the 'hole' because there are multiple 'holes' in the device which need to be numbered and need to distinguish the different types of 'holes' within the network element, which may have different capabilities in terms of SFP modules which can be plugged-id.\r\n\r\nIt has been agreed that the four cases (pluggable transceiver port, non-pluggable transceiver port, empty hole and non-pluggable integrated port) apply to both optical and electrical ports.\r\n\r\nJeff: it is important to highlight that a port is the starting point of a service.\r\nNigel: In TAPI the access port has been defined (considered) as conceptual bridge between the logical model and physical model.\r\n\r\nItalo: I am not sure we need to associate the port with the service or a new object to bridge between the functional view and the hardware/equipment view. The service starts from an LTP and the LTP can be associated with a port.\r\n\r\nIt has been agreed that there is no need to report two components for the Tx and Rx connector. A single 'port' component instance can be used to report the combination of the Tx and Rx connectors. In case of bidirectional connectors (e.g., a pin terminating a bidirectional fiber or an RJ-45 connector), a single 'port' component instance can be used to report the bidirectional connector.\r\n\r\nJeff: for me, on a pluggable, the port is the connector or the combination of the Tx and Rx connectors\r\n\r\nIt was highlighted that the SFP module and the connector/connectors pair can be modelled as a single 'port' component. In this case, there  is no need for a new component class (the 'transceiver' component class in the slides) and no need to differentiate in the model between the non-pluggable transceiver port and the non-pluggable integrated port.\r\n\r\nJeff disagreed not have a specific component for transceiver.\r\n\r\nThis issue needs further discussion.\r\n\r\nThe slides propose to model the 'hole', where an SFP module can be plugged-in, as a 'port' component instead of as a 'container' component\r\n\r\nThere was no agreement on whether the 'hole', where an SFP module can be plugged-in, should be modelled as a 'port' component or as an holder component of a different class (e.g., 'container' component class or as a new component class)\r\n\r\n- [x] @italobusi  send a mail to the IVY WG to gather more feedbacks also from other operators on how to model the 'hole' where an SPF module can be plugged-in\r\n",

Supporters of one option can reply to the mail with their opinion about the advantages of the option they prefer.\r\n\r\nThe objective is to get a decision between option 1 and option 2 before the next call (May 22, 2024).\r\n\r\nIf option 2 is selected, we can later discuss the pros&cons of reusing the 'container' component class or defining a new component class, such as the 'cage' as proposed by BBF.\r\n\r\nNigel thinks that the hole is present with or without anything plugged-in and its capabilities have to be reported. Even if some holes are specialize for a single type of SFP, nothing precludes holes that can have different types of SFPs or with more than one 'port'.\r\nAn 'hole' can also host some other type of module (e.g., a memory module) without any external connector, not necessarily a transceiver.\r\n\r\nAihua reported the use case to retrieve all the capabilities of a board, including the empty 'holes', pluggable ports and non-pluggable ports.\r\n\r\nAccording to Nigel the capability of the cards should be known by the controller before the card is plugged-in either through offline information or by some capability model.\r\n\r\nPrasenjit reported that if there is a mismatch between the capabilities of the 'hole' and what it is plugged-in, an alarm should be raised.\r\n\r\nAihua reported that in the published BBF the 'transceiver-link' component is not used to report a optical connector but the 'transceiver' function within an SFP module (which is modelled in BBF as a 'transceiver' component). There are scenarios where a single SFP module can contain more than on 'transceiver' functions.\r\n\r\nIt has been highlighted that the current approach in IVY WG is to decouple the functional view from the hardware view. The functional view of the 'transceiver' is already modelled in the optical impairments topology and equally applies to the 'transceivers' hosted in an SFP module as well as those hosted on a 'transponder card'.\r\n\r\nIt may be worthwhile having some examples of the PON possible configurations to check how the base model can be used to model the PON port, especially those at the OLT.\r\n",

With this approach there is no need to define a container component class (as in RFC8348) because there is no need to report the empty slots nor the empty SFP holes in the list of installed components.\r\n\r\nConcerns have been raised about how the following scenarios can be supported without defining a container component class:\r\n- boards which occupy more than one slot\r\n- logical partitioning (by software-only configuration) of one slot into sub-slots\r\n\r\nIt was also noted that reporting the available slots and SFP holes only in the capability model and not in the component list would make the implementation of the capability model mandatory when reporting the empty slots and SFP holes is required.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nBased on this discussion, we can summarize the possible solutions with four options, which differs in:\r\n- whether it is consistent or not with the OpenConfig approach\r\n- whether it is using or not the RFC8348 container component class to model the slots\r\n- whether it has or not consistent models for the slots and the SFP holes\r\n- whether the implementation of the capability model is required or not to report the empty slots and SFP holes\r\n\r\nOption 1:\r\n\r\n```\r\n+-- chassis\r\n    +-- container                 // slot: empty when there is no child module component\r\n        +-- module                // board\r\n            +-- container         // SFP hole (only for pluggable ports): empty when there is no child module component\r\n                +-- module        // transceiver(s) module (optional for non-pluggable ports)\r\n                    +-- port      // non-MPO port\r\n```\r\n\r\n- not consistent with the OpenConfig approach\r\n- use the RFC8348 container component class to model the slots\r\n- consistent models for the slots and the SFP holes\r\n- implementation of the capability model is not required to report the empty slots and SFP holes\r\n\r\nOption 2:\r\n\r\n```\r\n+-- chassis\r\n    +-- module                    // empty slot or board\r\n        +-- port                  // empty SFP hole or port (MPO or non-MPO and pluggable or non-pluggable port)\r\n            +-- transceiver       // transceiver(s) module (optional for non-pluggable ports)\r\n```\r\n\r\n- consistent with the OpenConfig approach\r\n- do not use the RFC8348 container component class to model the slots\r\n- consistent models for the slots and the SFP holes\r\n- implementation of the capability model is not required to report the empty slots and SFP holes\r\n\r\nOption 3:\r\n\r\n```\r\n+-- chassis\r\n    +-- module                    // board\r\n        +-- module                // transceiver(s) module (optional for non-pluggable ports)\r\n            +-- port              // non-MPO port\r\n```\r\n\r\n- not consistent with the OpenConfig approach\r\n- do not use the RFC8348 container component class to model the slots\r\n- consistent models for the slots and the SFP holes\r\n- implementation of the capability model is required to report the empty slots and SFP holes\r\n\r\nOption 4:\r\n\r\n```\r\n+-- chassis\r\n    +-- container                 // slot: empty when there is no child module component\r\n        +-- module                // board\r\n            +-- port              // empty SFP hole or (pluggable or non-pluggable) non-MPO port\r\n                +-- transceiver   // transceiver(s) module (optional for non-pluggable ports)\r\n```\r\n\r\n- partially consistent with the OpenConfig approach (only for the ports but not for the slots)\r\n- use the RFC8348 container component class to model the slots\r\n- not consistent models for the slots and the SFP holes\r\n- implementation of the capability model is not required to report the empty slots and SFP holes\r\n\r\n- [ ] @italobusi ask the following questions to the IVY WG\r\n\r\n1) How important is to maintain consistency with the OpenConfig approach in IVY WG?\r\n2) How important is to support the following scenarios (which can be supported using the RFC8348 container component class to model the slots)?\r\n   - boards which occupy more than one slot\r\n   - logical partitioning (by software-only configuration) of one slot into sub-slots\r\n3) How important is to have consistent models for the slots and the SFP holes?\r\n4) How important is to implementation of the capability model required or not to report the empty slots and SFP holes?\r\n\r\n",

My understanding is that you are proposing to:\r\n\r\n1. model the \"MPO connector\" as one component instance of class 'port' and to define the container groups under the component with some when statement to make it applicable only to components of type 'port'\r\n\r\n2. define an entry in the group list to represent the set of lanes/pins which are associated with a single client interface (an entry in the group is something similar to the TAPI access-port)\r\n\r\n   For example, considering example 5 in slide 10 of [port-examples-09.pptx](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/15905050/port-examples-09.pptx), there will be M groups where the group 1 (associated with client 1 interface) has K lanes while group M (associated with client M interface) has one lane\r\n\r\nIs my understanding correct?\r\n",

This looks like the same as case 1 in https://github.com/ietf-ivy-wg/network-inventory-yang/issues/64#issuecomment-2359312360\r\n\r\nIMHO, using the stack component is not needed but also not precluded as show for case 3 in https://github.com/ietf-ivy-wg/network-inventory-yang/issues/64#issuecomment-2359312360. However, my feeling, is that this would be more useful when there is a need to report more than one group of chassis (stacks) within the same network element",

      "body": "My thoughts and Sergio's comments labeled with [SB]\r\n\r\nThe issue is finding terminology that will be agreeable to network equipment vendors, data center people, and computer hardware people.  The idea is simple, but can be mapped onto different terminology.\r\n\r\nFor example.\r\n\r\nA rack is a metal frame that may or may not contain electrical components that holds a chassis.\r\n\r\nA standard rack holding something like a Cisco 8804 chassis looks like this.\r\n\r\n![download](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f52983c7-d6dd-4e5a-8da5-716a02daa1aa)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe big holes you see in the picture above are slots.  There are slots on the back as well.  A slot can accept various modules, trays, or cards.  Some modules and/or cards can have daughter cards can be connected to the module or card.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nLooking at the Network Inventory YANG terminology.\r\n\r\nThe rack, chassis and slots above are (as TMF puts them) holders. \r\n\r\n[SB>] YES the TMF separation between \u201cholders\u201d and \u201cequipment\u201d groups  is also in our document\r\n\r\nAn example of a sub-chassis could be a tray that holds other components (like fans).  In the Network Inventory YANG the term Board is (I think) a module or a card. \r\n\r\n[SB>] In our model a board is defined as\u201d ianahw:module\u201d , there is no distinction unfortunately from module to card/board.\r\n\r\nUsually, modules are things like fans or power, so if we are modeling that we will need to differentiate a module from a card (so calling both of those board is probably wrong). \r\n\r\n[SB>]  Fan is considered as a specific card, it has a definition specific, not as ianahw:module .\r\n\r\nThere is a differentiation between cards as well (at least in Cisco-land).  There are \u201cline cards\u201d and \u201cfabric cards\u201d.  A line card has ports on it and in the case of optical pluggables a line card may have slots to accept pluggables. I don\u2019t know if that is what is intended by the \u201csub-slot\u201d terminology, but it could work since a pluggable would be considered a module that fits into a cards' sub-slot.  At least that is one interpretation. \r\n\r\n[SB>] In this case we would have a definition for sub-slot that should be \u201ca slot of a line-card hosting an optical pluggable\u201d\r\n\r\nA \u201cfabric card\u201d is a card that \u201cline cards\u201d and sometimes modules plug into.  But here the \"sub-slot\" terminology doesn't really work very well, because the \"sub-slot\" on the \"fabric card\" is not inline with the slot the \"fabric card\" is in.  \r\n\r\nWhat needs to be made clear is whether or not a \u201csub-slot\u201d is simply a holder or if a \u201csub-slot\u201d can be used for something like an optical pluggable.\r\n\r\n[SB>] It can be used as a holder for an optical pluggable in my view.\r\n\r\nI think a couple of examples to see what the instance data would look would help.\r\n\r\nLooking at M.3100.  I would say recursive not circular.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nA rack is made up of bays\r\n\r\nA chassis is held in some number of bays of a rack depending on the size of the chassis.\r\n\r\nA chassis has slots (or physical places to put things)\r\n\r\nA chassis slot holds a \"circuit pack\" (which can be a line card, fabric card, computer, power, fans etc.)\r\n\r\nA line card can also accept pluggables\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI think leveraging M.3100 and mapping the terminology is a good exercise.  Things will get more interesting when the data center people show up and want to start talking about blades.\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @samans in https://github.com/ietf-ivy-wg/network-inventory-yang/pull/75#discussion_r1909574652_\r\n            ",

More feedbacks from other operators are welcome\n\n- [ ] @ju7ien: trigger some discussion in the IVY WG mailing list\n\nNote 1: with integrated OTs it is assumed an hardware configuration where the OT and the WSS cards are different  cards (usually on different shelves) which belong to the same NE and connected trough an external cable (and not through the backplane)\n\nNote 2: as a consequence, there is a requirement to report within the passive inventory both intra-NE and inter-NE cables\n\nNigel: Of course, like all passive inventory, the representation of the cable is (often) a statement of expectation, as the cable cannot be detected. Even where there is some mechanism for basic detection, the detector may not be functioning..\n\nSergio: Related to what Jeff is indicating about access-port in TAPI and the relationship between logical and physical model by access-port, we can say that in IETF we are on the same path with inventory-topology draft in which we make a reference between TP (termination point) and a port in inventory, where we abstract TP, and we make reference between a node to NE in the inventory, NE where we abstract node in topology model. \n\nNigel: Note that the TAPI solution allows reference from the TP equivalent to the physical environment via AccessPort which provides a fine grain reference to connectors and pins where relevant (the solution allows various degrees of detail including a reference to a whole connector where all pins are used etc.). Whilst the full flexibility may not be needed at this point, it is important to ensure that we design the solution to enable enhancement to the full flexibility.\n",

The component \"class\" is defined as a union between the hardware class identity, defined in \"iana-hardware\", and the \"non-hardware\" identity, defined in this document. Attributes related to specific class of component can be found in the component-specific-info structure.\" In the previous discussion, Italo suggested to remove class attribute and different types of components can be identified by the component-specific structure. I raised a concern that it is hard to do a filtering if there is not a class attribute. So I prefer to keeping class attribute still in this draft at first, and whetherto keep it or not still needs more discussions.  ",

              "body": "My thoughts and Sergio's comments labeled with [SB]\r\n\r\nThe issue is finding terminology that will be agreeable to network equipment vendors, data center people, and computer hardware people.  The idea is simple, but can be mapped onto different terminology.\r\n\r\nFor example.\r\n\r\nA rack is a metal frame that may or may not contain electrical components that holds a chassis.\r\n\r\nA standard rack holding something like a Cisco 8804 chassis looks like this.\r\n\r\n![download](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f52983c7-d6dd-4e5a-8da5-716a02daa1aa)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe big holes you see in the picture above are slots.  There are slots on the back as well.  A slot can accept various modules, trays, or cards.  Some modules and/or cards can have daughter cards can be connected to the module or card.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nLooking at the Network Inventory YANG terminology.\r\n\r\nThe rack, chassis and slots above are (as TMF puts them) holders. \r\n\r\n[SB>] YES the TMF separation between \u201cholders\u201d and \u201cequipment\u201d groups  is also in our document\r\n\r\nAn example of a sub-chassis could be a tray that holds other components (like fans).  In the Network Inventory YANG the term Board is (I think) a module or a card. \r\n\r\n[SB>] In our model a board is defined as\u201d ianahw:module\u201d , there is no distinction unfortunately from module to card/board.\r\n\r\nUsually, modules are things like fans or power, so if we are modeling that we will need to differentiate a module from a card (so calling both of those board is probably wrong). \r\n\r\n[SB>]  Fan is considered as a specific card, it has a definition specific, not as ianahw:module .\r\n\r\nThere is a differentiation between cards as well (at least in Cisco-land).  There are \u201cline cards\u201d and \u201cfabric cards\u201d.  A line card has ports on it and in the case of optical pluggables a line card may have slots to accept pluggables. I don\u2019t know if that is what is intended by the \u201csub-slot\u201d terminology, but it could work since a pluggable would be considered a module that fits into a cards' sub-slot.  At least that is one interpretation. \r\n\r\n[SB>] In this case we would have a definition for sub-slot that should be \u201ca slot of a line-card hosting an optical pluggable\u201d\r\n\r\nA \u201cfabric card\u201d is a card that \u201cline cards\u201d and sometimes modules plug into.  But here the \"sub-slot\" terminology doesn't really work very well, because the \"sub-slot\" on the \"fabric card\" is not inline with the slot the \"fabric card\" is in.  \r\n\r\nWhat needs to be made clear is whether or not a \u201csub-slot\u201d is simply a holder or if a \u201csub-slot\u201d can be used for something like an optical pluggable.\r\n\r\n[SB>] It can be used as a holder for an optical pluggable in my view.\r\n\r\nI think a couple of examples to see what the instance data would look would help.\r\n\r\nLooking at M.3100.  I would say recursive not circular.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nA rack is made up of bays\r\n\r\nA chassis is held in some number of bays of a rack depending on the size of the chassis.\r\n\r\nA chassis has slots (or physical places to put things)\r\n\r\nA chassis slot holds a \"circuit pack\" (which can be a line card, fabric card, computer, power, fans etc.)\r\n\r\nA line card can also accept pluggables\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI think leveraging M.3100 and mapping the terminology is a good exercise.  Things will get more interesting when the data center people show up and want to start talking about blades.",

Whilst a pure definition of physical, with no functional aspects, would be preferable, the word is misused extensively across the industry and hence we have to align with that misuse.\r\n",
