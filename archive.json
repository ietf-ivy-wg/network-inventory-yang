Complex configurations where an HW component can support multiple SW versions can be modelled using the SW inventory extension model: in this case, an HW-only component instance will have only the hardware-rev and it will contain one or more SW-only child component instances, which will have only the software-rev attribute\r\n\r\nAgreement to keep only onw software-rev attribute per component\r\n\r\nAgreement to add the software-patch-rev attribute (as a list) also for network elements\r\n\r\n- [ ] @YuChaode  update the YANG model and the draft as agreed during the call\r\n",

Some navigation capability is needed and the definition of the navigation can be in the scope.\r\n\r\nNeed to clarify that the term inventory in our context is not an unconstrained 'list of anything' but be more precise about the scope of what we are listing. In our context for this initial work, inventory is a representation of the structure of physical things (i.e., not just a list and not all things).\r\n\r\nThere are informational things. Software is an 'informational thing' and it is in the scope of the work (although perhaps not in the first stage). Note that software is not {{Italo: I added not here as I think that that is what you meant to type and it is certainly what I was trying to say}} intended to be the running software which instead is representing the emergent 'functional behavior'.\r\n\r\n- [ ] @nigel-r-davis  prepare some diagrams to show the entities in the scope of our work\r\n\r\nA traditional NE is an assembly of physical things, informational things, the functionality emergent when powered along with the method of access.

There are also hybrid NEs with some virtual components and some physical components.\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested also to look at the definitions in draft-palmero-ivy-ps-almo (in particular the asset definition) to see if there are also some concepts that can be used to defined what is in the scope for IVY \r\n\r\n- [ ] Marisol: suggest some improvements to the definitions based on TMF\r\n",

What is configured which represents the clients' intention is present in intended ds, and if the server cannot apply the configuration successfully (e.g., because it doesn't match the real hardware), the intention won't be present in operational ds, i.e., only what is actual in use is present in operational ds.\r\nA couple of IETF-published YANG has followed this way, e.g., \r\n\r\n- RFC 8348, regarding how the server supports pre-provisioning of hardware:\r\n  `When the server detects a new hardware component, it\r\n           initializes a list entry in the operational state.\r\n\r\n           If the server does not support configuration of hardware\r\n           components, list entries in the operational state are\r\n           initialized with values for all nodes as detected by the\r\n           implementation.\r\n\r\n           Otherwise, this procedure is followed:\r\n\r\n             1.

The model does not yet cover some physical aspects such as connectors, cables, strands and physical spans. We have some work that may be helpful in TAPI. We should avoid broad physical modeling such as geographic structures etc.\r\n\r\nthe ability to hot-swap and to deal with other dynamics should be considered in this model.\r\n\r\nOther characteristics such as height, length, width, weight etc. may be best handled in a spec layer. This needs to be discussed in some details. This also applies to the humidity characteristics, fire characteristics, power rating, thermal ratings, physical stress and mechanical vibration characteristics.\r\n\r\nThe model intentionally does not cover functional aspects. We should work on the relationship between functional and physical. The functional model relationship needs to deal with \"equipment protections\" which is really functional protections. ONF have some work that may help here.\r\n\r\nThere are a few cases of mechanical functionality (such as a fan). This could be covered here (e.g., the property fan-speed could be a valid augment to a module that has a fan.\r\n\r\nThe model of temperature, humidity and other environmental aspects (especially when measured) relate closely and should be considered carefully.\r\n\r\nThe model of power is unusual in that it is narrow functional. There is a flow etc. The relationship between this model and power  needs to be considered carefully. Power is not physical but from the perspective of the other functions it is essentially the motive force. There is no detailed model of power. In other bodies, power is \"smunged\" into the physical model.  This needs to be considered very carefully.\r\n\r\nThe model of software is complex and should be separate from the model of the physical solution.\r\n\r\nState machines associated with the power-up cycle, admin state etc. really related to the functional model and should be considered carefully.",

This enables providing federated datastores with a holistic network view without the need for redundant models and copies of the same data across different systems.  Such a capability could become of interest in the future should increasing amounts of management data need to be integrated with network inventory data, for example current state of inventoried elements, data about interfaces, etc.  \r\n\r\nThe proposal was overall well-received, with several attendees contributing to the discussion, involving questions related to scalability, differences between peer-mount and schema-mount, instantiation vs modeling issues.  A 00 draft is in the works and Alex stated that the authors of Peer-Mount are looking for potential coauthors.  \r\n",

These aspects of Frameworx establish a common language and reference for different elements of a service provider's operations, including assets, entitlements, and features.\r\n\r\n- Asset: In the TMF context, an asset is a valuable resource owned or controlled by an organization. This can include physical assets like hardware, logical assets like software, or informational assets like data.\r\n\r\n- Entitlement: In the TMF context, an entitlement usually refers to the rights or privileges that a specific user or customer has within a system or service or even to access a certain feature. These rights or privileges are typically based on the user's subscription or contract terms.\r\n\r\n- Feature: In the TMF context, a feature refers to a specific functionality or capability that a product, service, or system offers. When a customer subscribes to a service, they are given certain entitlements to use specific features.\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\nThe relationship between these elements can be understood as follows:\r\nAn asset (e.g., a network infrastructure, software system, etc.) provides certain features (capabilities or functionalities). The users or customers of the service are given entitlements (rights or privileges) to use these features based on their subscription or contract terms.\r\nFor instance, a software system (asset) may have a data analysis capability (feature), and a user might have an entitlement to use this feature based on their subscription level.\r\n\r\n",

Otherwise, the port component can be reported directly under the module component representing the board. \r\n\r\nEven the 'hole' has no serial-number, it is still need to model the 'hole' because there are multiple 'holes' in the device which need to be numbered and need to distinguish the different types of 'holes' within the network element, which may have different capabilities in terms of SFP modules which can be plugged-id.\r\n\r\nIt has been agreed that the four cases (pluggable transceiver port, non-pluggable transceiver port, empty hole and non-pluggable integrated port) apply to both optical and electrical ports.\r\n\r\nJeff: it is important to highlight that a port is the starting point of a service.\r\nNigel: In TAPI the access port has been defined (considered) as conceptual bridge between the logical model and physical model.\r\n\r\nItalo: I am not sure we need to associate the port with the service or a new object to bridge between the functional view and the hardware/equipment view. The service starts from an LTP and the LTP can be associated with a port.\r\n\r\nIt has been agreed that there is no need to report two components for the Tx and Rx connector. A single 'port' component instance can be used to report the combination of the Tx and Rx connectors.

Supporters of one option can reply to the mail with their opinion about the advantages of the option they prefer.\r\n\r\nThe objective is to get a decision between option 1 and option 2 before the next call (May 22, 2024).\r\n\r\nIf option 2 is selected, we can later discuss the pros&cons of reusing the 'container' component class or defining a new component class, such as the 'cage' as proposed by BBF.\r\n\r\nNigel thinks that the hole is present with or without anything plugged-in and its capabilities have to be reported. Even if some holes are specialize for a single type of SFP, nothing precludes holes that can have different types of SFPs or with more than one 'port'.\r\nAn 'hole' can also host some other type of module (e.g., a memory module) without any external connector, not necessarily a transceiver.\r\n\r\nAihua reported the use case to retrieve all the capabilities of a board, including the empty 'holes', pluggable ports and non-pluggable ports.\r\n\r\nAccording to Nigel the capability of the cards should be known by the controller before the card is plugged-in either through offline information or by some capability model.\r\n\r\nPrasenjit reported that if there is a mismatch between the capabilities of the 'hole' and what it is plugged-in, an alarm should be raised.\r\n\r\nAihua reported that in the published BBF the 'transceiver-link' component is not used to report a optical connector but the 'transceiver' function within an SFP module (which is modelled in BBF as a 'transceiver' component). There are scenarios where a single SFP module can contain more than on 'transceiver' functions.\r\n\r\nIt has been highlighted that the current approach in IVY WG is to decouple the functional view from the hardware view. The functional view of the 'transceiver' is already modelled in the optical impairments topology and equally applies to the 'transceivers' hosted in an SFP module as well as those hosted on a 'transponder card'.\r\n\r\nIt may be worthwhile having some examples of the PON possible configurations to check how the base model can be used to model the PON port, especially those at the OLT.\r\n",

My understanding is that you are proposing to:\r\n\r\n1. model the \"MPO connector\" as one component instance of class 'port' and to define the container groups under the component with some when statement to make it applicable only to components of type 'port'\r\n\r\n2. define an entry in the group list to represent the set of lanes/pins which are associated with a single client interface (an entry in the group is something similar to the TAPI access-port)\r\n\r\n   For example, considering example 5 in slide 10 of [port-examples-09.pptx](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/15905050/port-examples-09.pptx), there will be M groups where the group 1 (associated with client 1 interface) has K lanes while group M (associated with client M interface) has one lane\r\n\r\nIs my understanding correct?\r\n",

Therefore this type of name cannot be used as a key of a YANG list\r\n\r\nThere are also some cases where it is very hard to guarantee uniqueness of the names (e.g., when there are multiple controllers creating entries in the list): https://github.com/tsaad-dev/te/issues/50)\r\n\r\nTo avoid these issues the keys of the list can better be URIs or UUIDs\r\n\r\nTo give more implementation freedom we have agreed to define the key as a string which may or not match with the name, the UUID,  or the URI:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ietf-ivy-wg/network-inventory-yang/blob/main/minutes/minutes-2024-01-17.md\r\n\r\nWe have proposed to add some clarification text to the I-D: see PR #65 \r\n\r\nCo-Authored-By: YuChaode <yuchaode@huawei.com>\r\n",

This looks like the same as case 1 in https://github.com/ietf-ivy-wg/network-inventory-yang/issues/64#issuecomment-2359312360\r\n\r\nIMHO, using the stack component is not needed but also not precluded as show for case 3 in https://github.com/ietf-ivy-wg/network-inventory-yang/issues/64#issuecomment-2359312360. However, my feeling, is that this would be more useful when there is a need to report more than one group of chassis (stacks) within the same network element",

The component \"class\" is defined as a union between the hardware class identity, defined in \"iana-hardware\", and the \"non-hardware\" identity, defined in this document. Attributes related to specific class of component can be found in the component-specific-info structure.\" In the previous discussion, Italo suggested to remove class attribute and different types of components can be identified by the component-specific structure. I raised a concern that it is hard to do a filtering if there is not a class attribute. So I prefer to keeping class attribute still in this draft at first, and whetherto keep it or not still needs more discussions.  ",
